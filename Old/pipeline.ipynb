Visualization Highlights Web-based System for Responding to Critical Infrastructure Breakdown When a large scale disaster, such as a hurricane, hits, breakdowns at key points in the electrical grid can cascade over telecommunication, water, gas, road, and other systems. Key facilities, such as schools, police and fire stations, government building, and hospitals, can be affected significantly. In this research funded by DHS, we have developed a Web-based tool to tap into simulations for thousands of different hurricane paths, immediately selecting the one that most closely matches the current event and visualizing the results so they can be rapidly understood and acted upon. The database can also be updated on-the-fly with new simulations that follow the predicted hurricane path. Thus an emergency responder in the field can get updates about when a hurricane will hit her area, where and what parts of the infrastructure will be disrupted, what key facilities will be affected and when.

       "  'Cognitive Science Program Skip to Main Content Cognitive Science Program Director: Dr. Doug Markant (cog-sci@uncc.edu) What is Cognitive Science? Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the processes and representations of the mind that enable intelligent thought and action in humans, animals, and machines. Of central concern are cognitive abilities of perception and action, attention and cognitive control, memory, knowledge and language, problem solving, reasoning, decision making, and emotion. Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte began with the formation of the Cognitive Science Academy, an interdisciplinary community of faculty and students engaged in advancing the discovery, dissemination, and application of knowledge in cognitive science. The program provides an interdisciplinary approach by building upon the strong academic programs that are already in place in its contributing departments—Psychology, Computer Science, Software and Information Systems, Philosophy, English, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Civil Engineering. The Cognitive Science program at UNC Charlotte is committed to social justice, celebration of diversity in background and viewpoints, and inclusion. For more information about our efforts toward these goals, please see the Department of Psychological Science statement on social justice, which summarizes both our philosophy and the actions our faculty are taking to address issues of social injustice and inequity. Undergraduate & Graduate Programs UNC Charlotte offers an undergraduate minor, and a graduate certificate in Cognitive Science. Students in the graduate certificate program may also consider applying for the General Masters in Psychology (Cognitive Option) program offered by the Department of Psychological Science after consulting with their faculty mentor in the graduate certificate program. What careers are available in Cognitive Science? The skills acquired by cognitive science students are applicable in many career fields, particularly those associated with the information industry including telecommunications, information processing, medical analysis, data representation and retrieval, education, scientific research, and multimedia design. Cognitive Science graduates can apply their skills to positions in human factors and computer-human interactions, artificial intelligence (creating computer systems that demonstrate what appears to be intelligent behavior), human performance testing, education, and neurological testing.',\n",

The Levens and Emotion and Cognition Lab is an interdisciplinary lab that identifies the mechanisms involved in processing and regulating emotional information, and how individual variability in emotion processing and emotion regulation is associated with individual differences in behavior and a range of mental and physical health outcomes including depression, posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress disorder, food attitudes, obesity and type 2 diabetes. To investigate these mechanistic and behavior relationships we design in-person and online experiments that capitalize on a range of behavioral techniques in a range of populations, including undergraduates, national online samples, individuals with attention deficit disorder, veterans, and individuals who have suffered traumatic experiences. We also regularly collaborate with labs that use physiological, neuroendocrine and functional neuroimaging methodology (including fMRI and EEG).

This initiative is a campus-wide partnership operated out of the Office of Identity, Equity, and Engagement.UNC Charlotte utilizes the term \"trans\" as an umbrella and inclusive term for those that transgress or transition between gender norms. This could include, but is not limited to, those who identify as transgender, transexual, transvestite, individuals with an intersex condition, genderqueer or non-binary individuals.These individuals often transcend and transgress gender norms. They often find it difficult to navigate systems that are set up with only two separate gender options (male/female).Some trans people seek medical and/or legal means to change their assigned birth sex or gender and some may simply identify or present themselves differently than their assigned birth sex or gender. The purpose of this website is to provide basic information, policies and support resources for trans students on UNC Charlotte\\'s campus. Information — Discusses basic information on trans identities and national organizations for trans individuals.Policies — Outlines UNC Charlotte departmental policies and procedures that may affect trans students, as well as information on North Carolina and Federal guidelines for changing your name and/or gender marker.Support — Houses information on support for trans students both on and off campus and resources for those looking to transition.Restrooms — Designates all buildings on campus and discusses what restrooms are available in each building. Sometimes finding a comfortable place to use the facilities can be difficult for people who do not identify as male or female or may be in the process of transitioning.Contact — For questions regarding the Trans Committee at UNC Charlotte please contact Dr. Erica Lennon.As of October 2017, the Campaign for Southern Equality has just published its Trans resource list for the South. In this new version of Trans in the South, you’ll find lists of trans-friendly service providers – from doctors to attorneys to counselors – across the South as well as resources to assist with funding medical transition. Over the past year we’ve worked hard to add more resources to each state in the guide. And we’ve significantly expanded resources related to HIV/AIDS services and added resources that offer support services for trans folks. In recognition and appreciation of grassroots work led by trans folks across the South, this update also includes links to local resource guides.',\n",

The 49er Democracy Experience offers the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and its community a dynamic, nonpartisan platform for learning about and engaging in civic life. Launched prior to the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, the 49er Democracy Experience continues as a galvanizing driver of informed citizenship: voter registration, primary and election news, volunteer opportunities and more. Civic Engagement at UNC Charlotte Education and civic engagement go hand-in-hand. At UNC Charlotte, the entire University community is able to learn about and get involved in the issues, discussions and democratic processes necessary to shape a productive society. Through the 49er Democracy Experience, expert faculty, civic-minded students and community partners come together to deliver educational programming and participate in activities that enhance public understanding of and participation in the democratic process. As North Carolina’s urban research university, UNC Charlotte is a natural leader for this initiative. Through the 49er Democracy Experience, the University’s commitment to addressing the cultural, economic, educational, environmental, health and social needs of the greater Charlotte region is realized. Higher Education Act & Civic Engagement The reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act and the National Voter Registration Act include a requirement that higher education institutions make a “good faith effort” to make voter registration forms available to all enrolled students. This federal legislation is consistent with and supports the University's long-standing goals of engendering leadership and citizenship among the student body.\",\n",

       "  'Broadening Participation in CS4All in NC Skip to Main Content CS4All What We seek to enhance the teaching of Computer Science content using online resources with a long term goal to increase participation in high school courses by students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The goal of the partnership is to leverage the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course offered online by NCVirtual throughout NC. In the proposed work, we plan to address one of the structural constraints (e.g., not enough teachers) faced when broadening participation through the use of automated assessment tools. Furthermore, to make computing relevant to a diverse student population, we plan to create culturally responsive teaching materials and train teachers on their use. We will accomplish these goals by creating an RPP in NC. Who This project seeks to create a \\u200bResearch-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) with the NCVirtual, researchers at UNC Charlotte, and school districts near Charlotte. Why As our world continues to become more technology driven, the need for computer scientists continues to surge. Unfortunately, technology growth and the demand for computer scientists is outpacing how fast we can overcome our structural constraints to satisfy that demand. Furthermore, the existing inequities in society are limiting participation in computing to a select few groups. High schools struggle to not only get more teachers trained to offer CS courses, but also to diversify the students taking computing courses. All forecasts indicate that this demand for CS professionals will continue to grow. Based on the US Department of Labor statistics, Computer and Information technology jobs are predicted to increase 12% from 2018 to 2028. But the diversification of the workforce is not keeping pace with the growth. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2031496.

IEE\\'s Break Survival Guide Boundaries A boundary is simply a “dividing line” “In psychological terms, it’s a catch-phrase meaning setting limits or asserting your thoughts, feelings, and needs even when these are in opposition to the person with whom you’re interacting. Communicate with yourself, your partner, friends, and/or family about what you want/need. Get on the same page regarding what you all need to reduce miscommunication. Know Yourself Spend time reflecting on what you want to get out of your break. What is going to bring you joy? Make a list of people or things that you want to spend time with. Identify the item you want to say “yes” and “no” to. Find your core values, and follow those values every day to uplift you! Self Care If you know that you are going to be around certain emotionally taxing people, do not forget to put yourself first and either opt out or limit the amount of time you spend with individuals. Your feelings matter! Prioritizing taking care of yourself, this will allow you to show up for others the way you want to this season. Pick up your old hobby that you didn’t have much time to do during the busy semester or find a new hobby during this mini-break. Rest and Rejuvenate It is even more critical during a season of high demands to take care of yourself to reduce exhaustion, stress, and emotional vulnerability. Don’t forget to slow down and take a good deep breath. If you’re too busy getting caught up with everything, you may miss the things you tend to enjoy. Learn to Say \"No\" Knowing your limits and saying “no” is part of self-care. If someone takes \"no\" personally, it isn’t you; it’s them. Set your boundaries, put yourself first, and listen to what you need. University Resources Below are some of our university resources available for students.

The project collaborating team includes University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Clemson University, New Mexico State university, Florida International University, Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, OPAL-RT Corporation and Duke Energy. Lead Organization: The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Principal Investigator: Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan More about the project can be found here: https://www.redispv.org/ UNC Charlotte Smart Grid Lab Getting Smarter Created to educate the next generation of electrical power distribution engineers and to advance research into integrating renewable power into the grid, UNC Charlotte’s Duke Energy Smart Grid Laboratory has been fulfilling its mission since 2012. Partnering with utilities, universities and governmental agencies, the momentum of laboratory researchers has been increasing in the past two years with a number of new projects, including two major research grants from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) totaling more than $8 million. Throughout the life of the Smart Grid Lab, Duke Energy has provided financial support and research expertise to advance the study of power distribution and forecasting. Students from UNC Charlotte’s W.S. Lee College of Engineering who were trained in the lab have now gone on to work for Duke Energy, and are part of ongoing research collaborations between the utility and the university. The Smart Grid Lab is part of UNC Charlotte’s Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC). “The Smart Grid Lab is a resource that allows us to build research expertise, and educate undergraduate and graduate students who are now leaders in our partnering companies,” said Dr. Mike Mazzola, Executive Director of EPIC. “Since 2018, the lab has been advancing much of its previous research to full demonstration modes, which has been the purpose of the lab from the very start. The Smart Grid Lab is at the heart of two major grants we have won in the past two years.” In 2020, SETO awarded $4.6 million to UNC Charlotte Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan for the project “Optimal Reconfiguration and Resilient Control Framework for Real-Time Photovoltaic Dispatch to Manage Critical Infrastructure.” The purpose of the project is to advance solar energy’s role in strengthening the resilience of the U.S. electricity grid. The project is developing a grid management tool that detects cyber and physical threats, and forms dynamic clusters to optimally manage photovoltaics and energy storage. In 2021, SETO awarded a $3.6 million grant to improve the resilience and reliability of the regional electrical grid. Dr. Badrul Chowdhury, who holds a joint position as professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Systems Engineering and Engineering Management Department, is the principal investigator. The project, one of 10 chosen nationwide and the only one in North Carolina, is part of a collaborative effort among state government, utility companies, industry and universities to develop an advanced microgrid control architecture. The research will seamlessly coordinate microgrids with the bulk power grid at multiple points, automatically balancing load and generation while safely providing critical services. The proposed control architecture will be tested using a unique digital-twin approach, which will have direct, real-time connections between laboratories and microgrids. A field demonstration at Duke Energy’s Hot Springs microgrid is planned. Other ongoing projects in the Smart Grid Lab include: Distributed Energy Storage and EV Holding Capacity with Value Proposition Development = $90,000 Comparative Power Flow Analysis and Power Flow Quality Criteria – Phase I = $45,000Comparative Power Flow Analysis and Power Flow Quality Criteria – Phase II = $45,000 Identification, and Mitigation of Coordinated Attacks on Distributed Energy Management = $90,000 Developing a Combined System Model and Simulation Process for Integrated Planning and Operations across Transmission and Distribution Systems = $200,000 Planning an Affordable, Resilient, and Sustainable Grid in North Carolina = $201,000 Duke Energy Smart Grid Laboratory Computers have come to the electric grid, and the Duke Energy Smart Grid laboratory at The William States Lee College of Engineering is educating the engineers who will be running this improved grid and performing research to achieve top efficiency in the new digital world. The modernizing of the grid with digital devices is known as Smart Grid technology. This new technology is so important to improving grid efficiency that Duke Energy donated $1.8 million to help establish the Smart Grid Lab within the new Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC) building on the UNC Charlotte campus. Additional funding from the State of North Carolina for building space, equipment and infrastructure totals $1 million. “Grid modernization is a cornerstone of the type of research we are doing in EPIC,” said Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan, director of the Smart Grid Lab. “As such, we have been given a very beautiful corner location in the EPIC building to build our lab. It is a key spot in the building for demonstrating our research and educational programs.” The lab is important to both undergraduate and graduate education. “We are teaching the next generation engineers to join the power industry,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “This lab provides the learning environment to educate students to work in the smart grid world. We are also giving them the skills to be able to engineer and design the next-generation power grid.” At the heart of the lab’s extensive equipment are the Real Time Digital Simulators (RTDS). “RTDS lets us work in real time,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “We can pull in digital information about generation and transmission from multiple sources all at the same time and see how the system react during changing conditions. We can then experiment methodologies to make the power grid more efficient without putting the real grid at risk.” Advanced research and educational activities is being done in the Smart Grid lab by the EPIC Power Grid Modernization Cluster. This interdisciplinary group is composed of several faculty members and their associated graduate and undergraduate students. Grid modernizing research deals with digitized equipment, micro-processors and micro-computers based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED) being added to grid infrastructure to make it more reliable and efficient. Researchers collect and analyze data on how these digital systems, along with renewable energy, peaking power, redistributed loads and other components impact the grid. “We have a huge amount of resource space that allows us to collect and analyze all of the data being sent to us by multiple utilities,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “With RTDS we can determine how changing grid variables impact overall systems, and we can then suggest strategic grid level improvements. Most importantly, the lab will also serve as a vehicle for education and training related to grid modernization and thus help build next generation power grid workforce” In the near future the Smart Grid Lab will be integrated with additional power systems laboratories on the ground floor of EPIC. This connection with the five labs of the Duke Energy Power Suite will allow for even greater research, education and analysis of power generation capabilities and variables. For more information on the Smart Grid Lab contact Dr. Kamalasadan. College of Engineering Advancing the Future of Solar Energy At The William States Lee College of Engineering, our students, faculty and alumni are engaged in a multitude of activities that are advancing solar energy. In classrooms, our students are studying the principles of photovoltaics and tackling hands-on learning projects that teach them to work with solar energy. In laboratories, our researchers are designing improved solar cells, developing technologies for delivering solar power to the grid, and advancing methods for storing and using solar power at maximum efficiency. In the commercial world, our entrepreneurs are creating jobs as they take solar energy to the next level. As a state university, UNC Charlotte’s mission is to deliver higher education, improve the lives of citizens and support North Carolina industry. This mission makes the Lee College of Engineering’s solar power work extremely important, because North Carolina is the second largest solar power producing state in the country. “In North Carolina we have the second most capacity to connect solar power to the grid of any state in the country, behind only California,” said Dr. Mike Mazzola, executive director of UNC Charlotte’s Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC). “And we are actually number one in utility-scale solar power, because a lot of California’s generation is from residential roof-top solar panels.” Solar power production in North Carolina is expected to grow even faster in the next decade, thanks in part to NC House Bill 589. The measure, a collaboration between utility officials and solar interests, establishes a competitive bidding program and a solar power leasing program. “By allowing third-party solar producers to sell power to the grid, residential solar production will definitely be growing in North Carolina in the next few years,” Dr. Mazzola said. “South Carolina and Georgia are also adding a lot of solar capacity, making this region an even greater solar producer.” This growing solar industry will require a larger workforce to design, build, operate and maintain it, and solar engineers will be in greater demand. To prepare these future engineers, the Lee College of Engineering has numerous solar-related educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Solar Engineering Education “The founding mission of EPIC is workforce development,” Dr. Mazzola said. “Through college of engineering programs, we give students a taste of renewable energy, including solar, as part of their education. These efforts help inspire students who are excited and motivated about the future of renewable energy.” The college of engineering offers energy concentrations in all six of its undergraduate degree programs. The concentrations require students to take a group of technical electives focused on energy, which can include renewables, solar and grid integration of these technologies. Solar energy studies may also be part of required core courses. One example is Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) students designing and fabricating solar cells in the Cameron Center clean room, as part of their lab work in Sophomore Design ECGR 2252. In their year-long senior design projects, student teams have completed a number of solar-related projects in the past few years. Many of these projects are sponsored by solar power companies in the Carolinas. Examples of such senior design projects include: Design of a solar array micro-grid system for a 500kW solar facility in connection with SCE&G. Development of a simulation tool for Duke Energy to assess the benefits of battery energy storage on a power distribution system with large solar generation. Design of a rooftop photovoltaic array for a campus parking deck for UNC Charlotte Facilities. Development and field testing solar power companion inverters for Rivegy. A study to identify the potential uses of solar thermal energy at a regional utility plant on campus for UNC Charlotte Facilities. In a project for the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) addressing the vegetation maintenance issues associated with large solar farms, students have developed autonomous lawn mowers that use solar recharging stations. At the graduate level, Lee College of Engineering students also take renewable-energy-related courses, such as ECGR 4290 Science and Engineering of Photovoltaic. Many students also serve as research assistants, working with their faculty mentors on solar-related research. “At all levels,” Dr. Mazzola said, “there is an educational environment and culture surrounding our students here that deals with the very-real issues involved in renewable energy, a major part of which is solar.” Solar Engineering Research In the area of research, the college of engineering impacts solar energy from the fundamentals of producing better materials for solar cells, to the incredibly complex issues of how to use and store photovoltaic generated power for the grid. “With our state-of-the-art EPIC facilities, we are able to carry out solar research on a number of levels,” Dr. Mazzola said. “In our Photovoltaic Technology Research, Photovoltaic Integration, Renewable Power, Smart Grid, Flexible Energy and other laboratories, we have the capability to study, develop and test solar energy research. These capabilities are important to our researchers, and make us an attractive full-service applied research partner for working on grants with business and industry.” Some of the solar research now underway in EPIC laboratories includes: In the Photovoltaic Technology Research Laboratory, led by Dr. Aba Ebong, ECE, researchers are designing, manufacturing and testing new ways to make solar cells. The research is leading to improved efficiency in solar cells, while at the same time developing manufacturing techniques to make them more cheaply. Improvement methods include increasing the number of busbars to five from the standard three, using grid line segmentation to reduce metal shading to less than five percent, and using bifacial solar structures. Dr. Yong Zhang’s, ECE, research involves growing new semiconductor materials for power electronics, including solar power applications. Using molecular beam epitaxy methods, he and his students build materials a layer at a time, with each layer being as thin as one atom. The Photovoltaic Integration Lab is developing inverters for the crucial power interface between photovoltaic solar panels and the grid. Under the direction of Dr. Babak Parkhideh, ECE, the lab is using advanced power electronics to make inverters smaller and more flexible, with better efficiencies for PV integration Led by Dr. Madhav Manjrekar, the Renewable Power Laboratory consists of solar array simulators from Ametek, which can mimic power profiles generated either by a single solar panel or a large solar array. Capable of supplying from 35Vdc up to 1000Vdc, these simulators can be employed to test the latest panel-level micro-inverters or central solar inverters that support dc link voltages upwards of 800Vdc. A solar power research area of growing importance is the prediction, storage and use of solar generated power. A number of UNC Charlotte faculty are working on this issue. “The question is, when are people going to turn on the lights? When is the power going to be used? There has always been a degree of uncertainty knowing this,” Dr. Mazzola said. “With 10 percent of generation during the day now being solar, which has its own degrees of uncertainty, the questions of supply and demand become even more complex. And in the near future, when even more people have their own residential solar power to use and to sell to the grid, this will become even more complicated.” Researchers working on these questions include: Dr. Tao Hong and his Systems Engineering students are experts in the area of energy forecasting and optimization. Their work applies various statistical and optimization techniques to the development of algorithms and tools for energy forecasting, power system planning, renewable integration, reliability planning and risk management. Working with a Duke Energy photovoltaic and battery storage system testbed, Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan, ECE, and his students are compiling data and creating algorithms to increase the efficiency of how solar power is used on the grid. The work includes solutions for when to use the energy directly, when to store it in batteries, and when to use the battery power.

Solar Engineering Entrepreneurship Taking UNC Charlotte’s applied solar technology research to the next level, a number of startup companies have been formed to commercialize photovoltaic power solutions. “We’ve become a leader in entrepreneurship,” Dr. Mazzola said. “Beyond working on the fundamental problems of the technology, our researchers are also heling to spin off a number of companies. This application of research directly impacts North Carolina’s future by creating jobs and strengthening our economy.” Rivegy is a National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant funded company that was spun off from UNC Charlotte research. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is also collaborating with the company on power electronics architecture. Rivegy is developing power electronics for use in solar and other distributed energy applications. Its proprietary Rivegy SDSI (Software-defined Synthetic Inverter) enables low-cost, long-life, high-efficiency, and flexibility to usher in the next generation of smart distributed energy systems. Founded in 2011, the startup company Sinewatts works closely with researchers in the EPIC Photovoltaic Integration Lab. The company has won two rounds of funding from the Department of Energy’s SunShot Program. Its products are microchip inverters that convert the energy coming from solar panels from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Solar Engineering Future For the future, advance solar technologies will continue to be developed and refined. As legislation makes solar a more viable technology for home owners, the complexity of managing solar power will become even greater. “Solar power engineers will be needed in all these new areas to solve future problems,” Dr. Mazzola said. “We are educating and preparing these engineers. We are continuing to integrate more solar, and other renewable energy studies, into our curricula.” The social sciences, and even political science, will also play a bigger role in the future management of solar power, as consumer mindsets about energy use begin to change. “Right now, the amount of power we generate follows the amount of energy load that is needed,” Dr. Mazzola said. “We’re starting to see indications that there could be a complete reversal of this in the future, which means load demand will follow generation capability instead of visa versa. It’s going to be an interesting time. The research in our laboratories and the technologies developed by our spinoff companies is going to be extremely important in the creation of and management of solar power. At UNC Charlotte, we’re looking forward to it. We’re here and we’re ready.” Battery Energy Storage System Management for Improving Power Grid Reliability To improve the way solar power is integrated and distributed to the grid using grid level batteries, Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan and his students have been performing research at Duke Energy’s photovoltaic and battery storage system testbed in Catawba County since 2013. The research has developed and quantified a number of cost-saving measures, and soon the value-management system will be integrated in the field for managing the solar power farm. The Power Grid Connected Energy Storage Management project initially began as a battery storage system study for use with photovoltaics as part of grid modernization. The purpose was to solve the inconsistency problems of photovoltaics caused by weather changes. The researchers worked to balance solar power capacity by using batteries that are charged at times of excess solar output and then discharged when the power is needed on the grid. “We decided to start at the Sherrills Ford distribution feeder, which has an existing PV farm with 1 MW installed capacity,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “Nearby is a 250 KW/750Kwh battery storage facility. Our EPIC (Energy Production and Infrastructure Center) researchers had expertise in renewables, and we formed a team to develop an algorithm to smooth the output from solar energy. We concentrated on keeping voltage levels consistent when the PV output changes due to weather and simultaneously used the battery power to feed the feeder load during peak-load times.” The first step in the research was to gather field data to be used in building the feeder model and control algorithm. Based on the data, the team developed a control strategy for more evenly distributing the photovoltaic output. “First, in 2013-14, we developed a system to transfer the data through the internet to the Smart Grid lab at UNC Charlotte. After the communication link was successfully established we designed the initial testbed and evaluated the proof-of-concept,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “We then deployed the algorithm on a hardware controller to connect to the battery in the field. The results showed a much more efficient control performance than sending a signal from the UNCC campus.” Then the team developed a stacked algorithm to optimize battery charge and simultaneously supply battery power with three goals in mind, to smooth the PV farm output, regulate the voltage, and feed the feeder load at the peak power usage time. In 2015, they integrated historical weather patterns into the algorithm to optimize the amount of charge the batteries had at the start of the day, so that they would have the power needed for distribution on cloudy days or the capacity needed for storage on sunny days. “This was very challenging,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “There are always more variables to control in real life than what you plan for in the lab.” In 2016, the team looked at the actual dollar value of using battery storage with the stacked algorithm to smooth PV output, and at regulating the voltage and sending power from the battery during peak load. Five main power quality and energy management areas for monetary savings were identified and savings were calculated. The team also looked at how well the controllers performed in maintaining the voltage interacting with other controllers in the field. The next step in the project will be to develop a fully integrated value management system for use in the distribution system that will both manage the photovoltaics and calculate the overall commercial value. “Overall Duke Energy has benefitted in optimizing the efficiency of the feeder when the PV farms are integrated,” Dr. Kamalasadan said, “and UNC Charlotte has benefitted in being able to provide this wonderful learning experience to our students. What I like about this project more than anything else is that we converted the algorithm into a value-based approach that could quantify the actual savings. We demonstrated a strong business case model that shows how the algorithm can be deployed in the field based on monetary value.”',\n",

Working with dimensional tolerances on the order of 10 parts per million or better, precision metrology encompasses the methods of production and inspection in manufacturing, measurement, algorithms, tolerance representation, and the integration of metrology into factory quality systems. Our mission is to break new ground in precision metrology by addressing real-world industrial concerns. The Center received its initial federal support as a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (NSF I/UCRC) with two 5-year awards. The I/UCRC program is set up to allow industrial members and Center researchers to collaborate on projects that involve generic and specific manufacturing metrology problems. In support of these collaborative research efforts, the membership dues are applied to projects voted on by the members, supporting students through graduate research assistantships. This successful membership model has endured, although the Center has successfully graduated from the I/UCRC program in 2010. Additional specific research is funded through contracts with industrial partners to address proprietary application and development projects. The Center also engages in non-Affiliate research supported by the National Science Foundation, national laboratories, and other government agencies. Precision Metrology Exploration and applications of dimensional measurement to manufacturing and associated state-of-the-art processes with required dimensional tolerances on the order of ten parts per million; critical for remaining agile and competitive in a world economy where trends in all aspects of manufacturing are moving toward tighter tolerances. Interdisciplinary Synergy The Center for Precision Metrology synthesizes the practical needs for the industrial community with the interdisciplinary experience of faculty project leaders from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, chemistry, applied physics and business. These faculty have expertise encompassing machine metrology, precision controls, surface metrology applications and algorithms, computer-aided tolerancing and factory control, virtual and dynamic simulation, nanometric instrumentation, electro-optics and total quality management. Industrial Affiliate Membership Members of CPM’s Industrial Affiliates meet semi-annually to review progress of the projects within the program. Student researchers present their work and have the opportunity to discuss the technical details individually with industry leaders. In addition, new projects are proposed by faculty who collaborate with the industrial members to identify key projects that address generic and specific concerns in manufacturing metrology. Those projects which receive sufficient support of the members are initiated in the next year. Benefits of Affiliate membership include the frequent interaction with the Center’s faculty and students (many of whom end up working for affiliate members), access to the research projects as they are developed, and preferential access to the resources of the Center. Metrology and Associated Laboratories The Center maintains a host of state-of-the-art facilities in order to sustain research, development, and training in metrology. For critical measurement, many instruments are housed in a 1500 sq. ft. controlled environment, 20° ± 0.1° C, class 10,000 metrology laboratory.

Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte began with the formation of the Cognitive Science Academy, an interdisciplinary community of faculty and students engaged in advancing the discovery, dissemination, and application of knowledge in cognitive science. The program provides an interdisciplinary approach by building upon the strong academic programs that are already in place in its contributing departments—Psychology, Computer Science, Software and Information Systems, Philosophy, English, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Civil Engineering. The Cognitive Science program at UNC Charlotte is committed to social justice, celebration of diversity in background and viewpoints, and inclusion. For more information about our efforts toward these goals, please see the Department of Psychological Science statement on social justice, which summarizes both our philosophy and the actions our faculty are taking to address issues of social injustice and inequity. Undergraduate & Graduate Programs UNC Charlotte offers an undergraduate minor, and a graduate certificate in Cognitive Science. Students in the graduate certificate program may also consider applying for the General Masters in Psychology (Cognitive Option) program offered by the Department of Psychological Science after consulting with their faculty mentor in the graduate certificate program. What careers are available in Cognitive Science? The skills acquired by cognitive science students are applicable in many career fields, particularly those associated with the information industry including telecommunications, information processing, medical analysis, data representation and retrieval, education, scientific research, and multimedia design. Cognitive Science graduates can apply their skills to positions in human factors and computer-human interactions, artificial intelligence (creating computer systems that demonstrate what appears to be intelligent behavior), human performance testing, education, and neurological testing.',\n",

The items featured on this site highlight the ways in which UNC Charlotte, the surrounding community and the nation grieved together in the days, weeks and months following the tragedy. They showcase the resilience of our campus community and the ways in which we will always remember those who were lost and forever changed that day. In Remembrance Ellis Reed Parlier Midland, N.C. Ellis Reed Parlier, of Midland, N.C., was a 19-year-old who intended to pursue a Computer Science major after enrolling at UNC Charlotte in Fall of 2017. Reed loved video games and aspired to one day become a game developer. Reed was a graduate of the highly regarded Central Academy of Technology and Arts, where he studied in the Information Systems academy. He was generous with his time and talents, volunteering as a computer programming tutor for middle school students. Reed’s professors describe him as independent and motivated. We will not forget Reed. Riley Howell Waynesville, N.C. Riley Howell, of Waynesville, N.C., was a 21-year-old Environmental Studies major who enrolled in UNC Charlotte in Fall 2018 as a transfer from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College. Riley loved the outdoors, and Star Wars, and pizza; he played soccer and ran cross country in high school and was described by those close to him as upbeat and optimistic. Riley’s family describes him as always putting others ahead of himself, and nothing exemplifies that more than his final, heroic actions in defense of his fellow students. We will not forget Riley. We also hold close to our hearts the four members of Niner Nation who were hurt in this tragic incident -- Rami Alramadhan, Sean DeHart, Emily Houpt, and Drew Pescaro. Their strength inspires us all.

Light rail also provides greater accessibility for the citizens of the region to the resources of the University. Light rail stations at Ninth Street (beside UNC Charlotte Center City), J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte at North Tryon Street, and the UNC Charlotte Main Station along Cameron Boulevard at Wallis Hall (near North Deck) bring the convenience of light rail to the University\\'s doorstep. Benefits of light rail The LYNX Blue Line is the Charlotte region\\'s first light rail service; it opened in 2007. The line operates along 18.6 miles, from I-485 at South Boulevard to the UNC Charlotte campus. With 26 stations, including 11 park-and-ride locations, the LYNX Blue Line provides a congestion-free commute with a consistent travel time. Benefits of using light rail include: Affordable alternative to driving and parking on and off campus Relief from congested traffic Consistent travel time Environmentally clean, affordable transportation Close proximity to arenas, clubs, museums and employment centers Increased economic development and property values faqs Where are the light rail stations that serve UNC Charlotte? There are three light rail stations that serve the main UNC Charlotte campus. The UNC Charlotte Main Station is located along Cameron Boulevard at Wallis Hall (near North Deck). The other stations include J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte at North Tryon Street and Ninth Street (beside UNC Charlotte Center City). The 9th Street light rail station serves The Dubois Center at UNC Center City. How can students and staff use light rail? Students have a CATS All-Access Pass for unlimited rides on the CATS LYNX light rail, trolley, Special Transportation Service (STS), local and express bus routes, including the Airport Connector. Faculty and staff have the option to purchase the same pass at MyPark. CATS privileges are on the CATS-Pass app. Your All-Access Pass will appear in the \"Wallet\" section of the app. You must show the app to a fare inspector on LYNX light rail or scan your pass on the column when boarding a CATS bus. CATS Special Transportation Service (STS) provides door-to-door transit services within Charlotte\\'s city limits and the towns of Matthews and Pineville for individuals with disabilities certified as eligible according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). STS vehicles connect with Niner Paratransit for campus service. STS service requires user registration and CATS approval before being eligible to ride. This process takes 30 days on average to complete. Do students or employees with an All-Access Pass still need a ticket to ride? No, light rail and bus privileges are tied to the CATS-Pass app. Download the app to view your All-Access Pass in the \"Wallet\" section. Show your All-Access Pass when asked by a fare inspector on the train. On a bus, scan your pass on the column to board. If you are issued a citation because you did not have your All-Access Pass, you may appeal the citation with CATS. CATS may decline or approve the appeal at their discretion. UNC Charlotte will not refund citation fines. Can I purchase a CATS All-Access Pass for family or friends? No, only UNC Charlotte students and employees are eligible for the CATS All-Access Passes. You may purchase tickets at light rail station kiosks or use the CATS Pass Mobile Ticketing App. Does bus service connect to the light rail on campus? The campus bus system, Niner Transit, operates Monday through Sunday. Niner Transit stops at the UNC Charlotte Main Station. Visit PassioGO! to see live bus tracking. Is light rail accessible for all riders? Yes. CATS has worked to ensure all light rail stations and trains are accessible for people with disabilities. The University put in place accessible means to and from the campus station, including accessible pedestrian pathways. On campus, Niner Paratransit provides scheduled and on-demand disability transport for those with mobility impairments registered for the service. Designated pick-up and drop-off points are located around campus close as possible to accessible building entrances. Once I get off at UNC Charlotte Main Station, what are my on-campus transportation options? If you prefer not to take a Niner Transit bus to get around, you can also walk or rent a bike or e-scooter from the campus bike and e-scooter rental program. Can I connect directly from Amtrak to the LYNX Blue Line? Currently, there is not a direct link between Amtrak and the LYNX Blue Line. Use a ride-sharing service to access the Parkwood Station via 16th Street or take the 11 - North Tryon bus to either the Charlotte Transportation Center in uptown or J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte Station to transfer to the Blue Line. Can I park at a CATS light rail station? There are 11 Park & Ride stations along the Blue Line, with four on the extension. While parking is free at most Park & Ride stations, CATS charges a $10 exit fee at the J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte and University City Boulevard stations, unless riders have a valid CATS daily, weekly or monthly pass. Riders without a CATS daily, weekly or monthly pass will be required to pay to exit the parking decks at J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte and University City Boulevard stations. Remember, if you are a UNC Charlotte student, faculty or staff member with a CATS All-Access Transit Pass, your pass does not include parking fees incurred at a CATS facility. I don\\'t want to purchase a CATS All-Access Transit Pass. How can I purchase a single ticket for the light rail? You can purchase a ticket for light rail from CATS at a ticket vending machine located on every station platform or via the CATS-Pass app. To learn more about pricing, visit the CATS website.

New Model Reimagines National Parole And Probation Practices To Break Recidivism Cycle December 08, 2022 by Lynn Roberson Earning probation or parole may be challenging, but having it revoked is surprisingly easy – clogging prison systems and derailing an individual’s ability to build a productive life. Nationwide, one in four state prison admissions in 2017 were a result of a technical violation by someone on supervised release. With support from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), UNC Charlotte professor Shelley Johnson and her colleagues are building and piloting a novel approach they hope will break the cycle of recidivism and lead to a new national model for parole and probation practices.

The purpose of the Legal Studies minor is to enhance a liberal arts education across traditional disciplines, focusing on the theory and operation of law and legal institutions. The courses in the Legal Studies minor will expose students to the many facets of law as a social phenomenon – its evolution, function, motivating ideas and effects. In addition to fostering critical thinking and other transferable skills, the broad base of knowledge about law-related topics that students acquire in this minor better positions them for employment in governmental and nonprofit agencies, as well as business, where legal knowledge is beneficial.

UNC Charlotte’s Learning Community Program has transformed the way students live, learn, and succeed in their academic endeavors for almost 20 years. We find that Learning Communities help students transition through academic and social challenges by providing small, supportive living and learning environments. You will interact closely with UNC Charlotte faculty, staff and peer mentors through areas of common interest, enroll in two or more of the same courses and in many cases live together in the same residence hall. You will make friends and develop close relationships. While many Learning Communities are residentially based, some do not require living on campus or living in a specifically designated residence hall. All are one-year programs designed to assist students with their transition to campus life. Fifteen (15) learning communities are for freshmen and three are specifically designed for transfers. Whatever you are interested in–business, computing, English, health professions, history, international relations, leadership, or more–and even if you’re not sure yet, you are likely to find a community of interest.

Students are expected to demonstrate compassion by seeking help in potentially dangerous or life-threatening situations. The University does not want the fear of repercussions to be a barrier for seeking help. The Help Seeking Protocol provides students an opportunity to seek help for themselves or others while being connected to campus and community resources, in lieu of Accountability Procedures through the University. FAQs When does the help seeking protocol apply? The Help Seeking Protocol applies to the following circumstances regarding the possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs: students who seek assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on their own behalf; students who seek assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on behalf of another person(s) and who remain present until emergency personnel or University officials arrive; students who had assistance from emergency personnel or University officials sought on their behalf; organizations in which a representative(s) seeks assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on behalf of another person(s) and who remains present until emergency personnel or University officials arrive; or students and/or organizations who are victims and/or witnesses of a crime (including, but not limited to, sexual misconduct, interpersonal violence, assault, theft, or vandalism) and may have simultaneously violated University policy regarding the possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs. When does the help seeking protocol not apply? The Help Seeking Protocol does not apply to the following circumstances: students who are confronted by emergency personnel or University officials without having sought help or having help sought on their behalf law enforcement agencies working within their jurisdictions enforcing federal, state, or local laws (however, state laws related to medical amnesty may apply); or students who are engaging in behaviors other than possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs (including, but not limited to, driving under the influence, manufacturing/distribution/delivery of drugs, possessing with intent to manufacture/distribute/deliver drugs, sexual misconduct, or interpersonal violence). How is the help seeking protocol initiated? When the Help Seeking Protocol is initiated, the student or an organizational representative will be required to meet with a staff member from Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution to discuss the incident and available campus and community resources. The student or organization must agree to a recommended action plan, which may include a referral to the University’s Center for Wellness Promotion, referrals to other campus and/or community resources, educational programming, and/or parental notification. A student or organization, who fails to attend the required meeting or fails to complete any agreed upon action plan, will no longer be eligible for the Protocol and may be referred for Accountability Procedures, as outlined in University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility. Initiation of the Help Seeking Protocol is at the discretion of the Director of Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution or designee, who will consider all relevant facts in making the decision. If students or organizational representatives believe the Protocol applies, they are encouraged to contact the Director. Decisions on initiation of the Protocol are final and not appealable.',\n",

       "  'University Ombuds Skip to Main Content Welcome The University Ombuds program at UNC Charlotte is a confidential, independent, impartial, and informal resource for faculty, staff, and graduate students to informally work through challenging workplace problems, dilemmas and conflicts. The office adheres to the International Ombuds Association Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice. The University Ombuds uses a number of interest-based techniques, such as coaching, facilitated discussions, and shuttle diplomacy, to help prevent problems from escalating and empower faculty, staff, and graduate students find productive, collaborative solutions to their own problems when appropriate. Ombuds often help by providing an unbiased, non-judgmental listening ear to understand the situation, clarifying issues, by being a thought partner in exploring a full range of possible options, thinking through the pros and cons of the various choices, and helping visitors come to a decision on how they’d like to proceed. We also provide feedback on emerging or systemic concerns and recommendations for positive change to University policies and practices when appropriate. Communications with the Ombuds Office are confidential. The only exceptions are when we believe that disclosure is necessary to address imminent risk of serious harm or if required by law. The Ombuds is not part of any formal administrative complaint procedure, and communicating with the Ombuds does not put UNC Charlotte on formal notice of a problem. I look forward to meeting with you!

In addition, the International Festival, which is family-oriented, offers a number of elements such as mimes and face painting designed especially for children. In addition to the hallmark elements, the International Festival includes an international games zone for attendees of all ages to participate in and learn about the cultural significance of various games. Participants can learn the rules of archery, play a game of life-sized chess, or join in a soccer match. Founded in 1975, the International Festival continues to recognize the region’s growing diversity. Attendance at the International Festival in previous years has been estimated at over 20,000. The International Festival is made possible with support from several campus and community partners including Chartwell’s College and University Dining Services, Cone University Center, the Office of Business Affairs, the Office of International Programs, and Student Union Activities & Recreation.

       "  \"Welcome to the Faculty Legacy Scholarship Site | Faculty Legacy Scholarship | UNC Charlotte Skip to main content Vision To establish faculty-endowed scholarships that one day will enable all qualified students to attend UNC Charlotte with all of their financial need met. Brief History At the beginning of the spring semester of 2012, Michael Green, then President of the Faculty Council, presented an idea for initiating an endowment-based scholarship, funded principally by small payroll-deducted gifts given over a faculty member’s entire career. The arguments in favor of such a fund included: A college education is a transformative experience, perhaps the singular most important one in the lives of our youth. Hard economic times impact students and families disproportionately when tuition increases faster than inflation. Small gifts add up geometrically, and over many decades have the potential to become the largest endowed source of scholarships for UNC Charlotte. The FLS initiative allows participating faculty to leave UNC Charlotte a better place than when we arrived. Given these considerations and despite several years with no pay raise, the Faculty Council voted to establish an Ad Hoc committee to study the idea and make recommendations for its implementation. The Ad Hoc committee consisted of the President-elect of the Faculty Council, the individual college presidents, the four Bonnie Cone Distinguished Faculty, and three ex officio representatives from the Advancement Office, Financial Aid, and the Graduate School. Meeting weekly (an unprecedented schedule for university faculty), the Ad Hoc committee presented a set of recommendations to the Faculty Council at its March 22, 2012 meeting. The recommendations included (1) establishing the Faculty Legacy Scholarship, (2) adopting a statement of vision and principles, and (3) setting up a new standing committee of the Faculty Council – The Faculty Legacy Scholarship Committee. This committee will oversee the finances, procedures, and scholarship distribution of the FLS. Initially, the committee will award scholarships to students on the basis of both merit and financial hardship. Ultimately, the vision will be fulfilled when the FLS endowment is sufficiently large to meet the individual financial needs of all students admitted to UNC Charlotte. Early Years Scholarships The FLS is a hybrid, endowed fund. During its early years, 30% of gifts received one year will be awarded as FLS scholarships in the following year. The remaining 70% of gifts will be directed at growing the endowment. Eventually, the endowment will become sufficiently large so that it will generate increasing numbers of additional scholarships every year.

He has ten-plus years of experience in sports statistics and analytics, as well as a very deep and broad knowledge of analytics across multiple sports. He was one of the first statisticians in the country to implement analytics in the sports television industry, also known as advanced statistics. Tobias also creates scripts for ESPN broadcasters to help explain to the viewers about sports analytics for the games they cover. Tobias teaches courses in sports analytics and will be serving as an academic advisor for the school’s new undergraduate program. During the summer, Tobias runs four week-long camps throughout the country geared towards high school aged minority groups. Formally known as Strength In Numbers, the camp had its first successful run in 2022. The full list of School of Data Science faculty can be found here.

       "  'Student Experience Project Skip to Main Content Student Experience Project UNC Charlotte is proud to be one of six urban-serving institutions in the Student Experience Project (SEP) funded by the Raikes Foundation. SEP is a partnership between the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities (USU), the College Transition Collaborative (CTC), the Project for Education Research that Scales (PERTS), EducationCounsel, and five partner institutions: Colorado State University, Portland State University, the University of Colorado-Denver, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Toledo. About The Student Experience Project The Student Experience Project (SEP) is a collaboration of university leaders, faculty, researchers, and national education organizations committed to innovative, research-based practices to increase degree attainment by building equitable learning environments and fostering a sense of belonging on campus. The Challenge Colleges and universities are enrolling more diverse student populations than ever before. Yet, one-third of new college students will not graduate within six years. There remains a need for additional support and action to provide every student with an equal opportunity to graduate from college. Research has shown that under-represented minorities, low-income, and first-generation students do not do as well in our classrooms as their counterparts. Some of the forces contributing to these differential outcomes are extrinsic — students’ prior academic experiences or the off-campus jobs they must hold down to pay for college. But, as uncomfortable as it is, we must also acknowledge that there are intrinsic factors at play because there is evidence that faculty’s beliefs about mindset manifest in how students experience the course’s design, syllabus, pedagogy, and classroom environment — predicts outcomes. UNC Charlotte’s Faculty Avengers The Faculty Avengers Community of Practice started in the Fall of 2019. The goal of the instructor team is to create a continuous support network in which instructors can learn together, share ideas, and develop resources to support equity in classes. Together, we have implemented evidence-based changes in their classroom that have improved students’ sense of belonging, identity safety, social connectedness, and growth mindset. For a brief overview of key concepts, strategies, and resources, view the “Resources” tab above.

       "  'Department of Anthropology Skip to Main Content Home anthropology is the study of the human species. The discipline of Anthropology advances our collective understanding of who we are, where we came from, how we differ from one another, and what those differences mean. Anthropology is rooted in core values of mutual respect, equal rights, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination. As one of its early practitioners, Ruth Benedict of Columbia University, wrote, the goal of anthropology “is a world made safe for difference.” Earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Anthropology prepares students with the research skills and conceptual tools they need to enter any field or profession that benefits from understanding the causes and the range of variation in human experience, activity, identity, and values. Our alumni currently work in financial services, education, law, medicine, government, social services, the arts, and in corporate settings ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small family businesses. Read more >> addressing structural inequalities As the study of humanity and our closest relatives in the past and present, teaching and research in the Department of Anthropology at UNC Charlotte examine these topics using rigorous methods and theoretical perspectives which can generate knowledge in the service of social equity and human dignity. Anthropological approaches are well suited for understanding diversity, relations of power, and addressing a range of contemporary problems and injustices. This work requires continuing critical reflection on the way that histories of capitalist expansion and colonization have shaped the institutions in which we conduct our work, the academic disciplines we develop, and the conceptual frameworks through which we view the world. Because systemic forms of discrimination, exploitation, and marginalization can interfere with the ability of students and faculty to conduct research, to teach, and to learn, our goals must include the effort to identify, understand, resist, and dismantle these systems. graduate study at charlotte Watch our informational video about our program and applications for Fall 2023.

As chancellor of UNC Charlotte, I’m pleased to bring you greetings from Niner Nation! UNC Charlotte was founded just over 75 years ago as a night school catering to returning World War II veterans. We started out serving a class of just 278 students. Today, Charlotte is the third-largest institution in the UNC System, with more than 30,000 students enrolled. We are truly one of the great success stories in American higher education. We are the only public four-year institution serving Charlotte – the largest city in the Carolinas and one of the fastest growing and most dynamic regions in the country. This University is a major talent driver for our region and state, awarding more than 8,000 degrees and graduate certificates annually. To meet new challenges and to support the industries and communities in our region, we are pushing forward on a new vision to power the future for our region as an emerging top-tier global research university. With growing research expenditures, rising national recognition for innovative academic and student success programs, and impactful new partnerships and discoveries, Charlotte is climbing the ranks. This fall, we welcomed our largest-ever class of new first-year students and set a University record for new incoming graduate students. It’s exciting to see that more and more students are taking advantage of the transformative education and opportunities available only at Charlotte. There’s added excitement as the Charlotte 49ers begin competition in the American Athletic Conference. The move brings greater national media exposure and new competition, including in-state rival East Carolina. Charlotte is a great city, and this is Charlotte’s great University. This University is having a measurable impact on our students, their families and on the region and state we serve. I encourage you to learn more about UNC Charlotte and visit our campus. Go Niners!

The land on which the Observatory operates is a collective of several privately and publicly owned, preserved and conserved land parcels adjacent to the South Fork of the Catawba River in Gaston County, North Carolina (Map). The largest parcel of the conserved area is the Redlair Preserve, owned by the North Carolina Plant Conservation Program (PCP). View this story-map for an overview of Redlair from the PCP. View this video related to ongoing research related rock cracking being conducted at Redlair by Dr. Martha Cary (Missy) Eppes. Redlair Observatory activities are maintained and managed through a partnership of Universities, the State of North Carolina , and other non-profit organizations. The mission of the Redlair Observatory is to provide a much-needed, long-term, high-resolution database of groundwater, surface water, soils, ecology and weather that spans the South Fork floodplain up to small (95% of the watersheds of local streams and rivers. These small watersheds are major contributors to water quality in large rivers of the Piedmont, and the Observatory is located on the uban fringe of the largest metropolitan area in this region of the Carolinas. Observatory data will be available for researchers, planners, land managers and K-16 educators – providing long-term insight into undeveloped watersheds adjacent to the rapidly growing urban areas of Charlotte and Gastonia. The Observatory is broadly similar in its long-term mission in both research and education to federally funded Critical Zone Observatories and Long-Term Ecological Research Sites. Combined with its proximity to the rapidly growing Charlotte metropolitan area, the Observatory has strong potential to achieve distinction as a key location for natural data in the Piedmont of the southeastern United States. Note: Access to the Redlair Conservation Area is restricted and not open to the public except for permitted events. For more information contact Redlairleadership at googlegroups.com',\n",

This program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. Early entry provides undergraduates with the opportunity to complete up to a third of the M.Ed. in Reading while working on their undergraduate teacher education program. Additionally, Elementary Education majors completing the Reading Education Minor can count up to 9 hours of graduate courses toward BOTH the M.Ed. in Reading and the Reading Minor. Either way, early entry is a great way to complete part of your master’s in reading as an undergraduate teacher education student. One added benefit is that some graduate reading courses are offered during the summer. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate The ALII Certificate is a fully online 12-hour graduate certificate program designed to provide teachers and other educational professionals with tools to meet the literacy and learning needs of K-12 students. Apply to start the program any term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Master’s in Reading Education Learn more about our Graduate Reading Programs. The M.Ed. in Reading Education is a 33 credit-hour fully online program designed for classroom teachers, aspiring literacy and reading specialists and others whose work involves literacy education who are interested in improving instructional programs and practices that promote literacy among all learners. Apply to start the program any term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction with a Concentration in Reading The Literacy Education strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Reading Education, English Education, Teaching English as a Second Language, and Foreign Language Teacher Education encompassing dimensions of language, culture, and literacies broadly defined as they relate to urban education.

Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina.

What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program.

       "  'Integrated Behavioral Health Program Skip to Main Content Our Program Now Accepting Applications for AY24-25 IBH Scholars Cohort Apply Under the Participate Tab Now Accepting Applications for AY24-25 IBH Scholars Cohort Apply Under the Participate Tab Our Program Transformational changes are happening within healthcare in the United States. Healthcare systems are working to increase access, improve quality, and reduce cost. Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) models of care include evidence-based approaches that can reduce service barriers, improve patient mental and physical health, and provide greater cost-effectiveness in health care utilization (Woltmann et al., 2012; Katon et al., 2010; Melek et al., 2014). UNC Charlotte is training clinical social workers to meet these challenges. An estimated 46.6 million people in the U.S. experience mental health concerns each year; however, less than half (41%) actually receive behavioral health services (NAMI). 56 percent of those individuals treated are receiving services from a primary care provider rather than a trained behavioral health specialist (44%) (Kessler et al., 2005). IBH services bring specialized services to patients seeking care in settings that are familiar and destigmatizing. IBH is an interprofessional care approach where medical and behavioral health professionals work together to address patients’ overall health. IBH is holistic, patient-centered, team-based, and systems-oriented. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recently invested over $146 million for integrated behavioral health workforce development. Beginning in 2017, the UNC Charlotte School of Social Work originally received a four-year $1.8 million award to offer student stipends, interprofessional curriculum, enhanced training, and community education in 2017. The UNC Charlotte School of Social Work IBH Team working collaboratively with our community partners submitted a successful HRSA BHWET Grant Application and received continuation funding for four additional years. UNC Charlotte was notified over the summer that the application was successful and that we received renewal funding for our Integrated Behavioral Health Program. The focus of the HRSA BHWET Grant for the next four years is on high need children, adolescents, and transitional aged youth. SSW IBH Program Infographic What does the UNC Charlotte IBH Program do? The UNC Charlotte IBH Program is proud to be educating the future integrated behavioral health workforce and improving behavioral health care access regionally. Our program has four primary goals: 1. Develop MSW training and curricula that addresses IBH needs and reflects emerging innovation and evidence-based practice (EBP) models; 2. Create robust, well-supported IBH field placements within health care settings; 3. Establish highly desired placement opportunities for health care organizations and MSW students; and 4. Leverage unique opportunities to document community need, evaluate program effectiveness, and develop research studies We invite you to learn more about our training, partnerships, and evaluation/research activities.

       "  \"Welcome to the Women’s and Gender Studies (WGST) Program! | Women’s and Gender Studies Program | UNC Charlotte Skip to main content The Women's and Gender Studies Program at UNC Charlotte explores the ways that gender influences social structures and individual experiences around the world. We view gender as a category of analysis that includes women, men, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. Using a feminist perspective, the program seeks to understand the cultural, political, and historical processes that gender human identity and society. In our research, teaching, programming, and service we explore gender as it intersects with multiple categories, such as race, ethnicity, social class, age, ability, nationality, and sexuality. Recognizing that gender varies widely over time and space, the program emphasizes a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, with faculty employing a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches. The Women's and Gender Studies Program at UNC Charlotte offers an undergraduate minor in Women's and Gender Studies and a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies. Women's and Gender Studies also has an Honor Society called Iota Iota Iota (Triota). Our curriculum prepares students to understand how gender has shaped their own lives, the lives of others, the production of knowledge, and social institutions. Our undergraduate and graduate coursework also emphasizes the link between theory and practice and encourages applied learning through internships, community involvement, and service learning. Our curriculum is designed to develop a gender-sensitive perspective that will influence students' academic, professional, and personal development. It is our hope that this gender-sensitive perspective will lead students to ask the kinds of critical questions that are essential to imagining and creating an inclusive and equitable society.

IEE\\'s Break Survival Guide Boundaries A boundary is simply a “dividing line” “In psychological terms, it’s a catch-phrase meaning setting limits or asserting your thoughts, feelings, and needs even when these are in opposition to the person with whom you’re interacting. Communicate with yourself, your partner, friends, and/or family about what you want/need. Get on the same page regarding what you all need to reduce miscommunication. Know Yourself Spend time reflecting on what you want to get out of your break. What is going to bring you joy? Make a list of people or things that you want to spend time with. Identify the item you want to say “yes” and “no” to. Find your core values, and follow those values every day to uplift you! Self Care If you know that you are going to be around certain emotionally taxing people, do not forget to put yourself first and either opt out or limit the amount of time you spend with individuals. Your feelings matter! Prioritizing taking care of yourself, this will allow you to show up for others the way you want to this season. Pick up your old hobby that you didn’t have much time to do during the busy semester or find a new hobby during this mini-break. Rest and Rejuvenate It is even more critical during a season of high demands to take care of yourself to reduce exhaustion, stress, and emotional vulnerability. Don’t forget to slow down and take a good deep breath. If you’re too busy getting caught up with everything, you may miss the things you tend to enjoy. Learn to Say \"No\" Knowing your limits and saying “no” is part of self-care. If someone takes \"no\" personally, it isn’t you; it’s them. Set your boundaries, put yourself first, and listen to what you need. University Resources Below are some of our university resources available for students.

       "  'Department of Public Health Sciences Skip to Main Content Follow Us open positions Welcome Message from the Chair A time of Growth and Opportunity I am thrilled to share some incredibly exciting news with you. The College of Health and Human Services has been approved to transition to an accredited School of Public Health. We will become only the second accredited School of Public Health in North Carolina. The Department of Public Health Sciences has played a key role in advancing this goal and the next few years will be transformative as we navigate a larger presence on campus and in the community. Importantly for PHS, our Department will be growing. Just as a cell undergoes binary fission to multiply and grow, our department will experience a similar process; PHS will become two distinct academic departments. I firmly believe that this change will enhance our collective impact – elevating our degree programs, our students and our research within the field of public health. Two Thriving Entities: One department will house our existing Master of Health Administration (MHA)and BS in Health System Management degrees. Additionally, that unit will offer a new MPHconcentration in Health Policy (stay tuned for more information about that development!). The otherdepartment will house our BS in Public Health, MPH with concentrations in Community Health Practiceand Epidemiology, and our two PhD programs (one in Public Health Sciences and the other inEpidemiology). Both departments will maintain the high standards and collaborative spirit that defineus. This change is not about separation but about multiplication — creating two strong pillars that willsupport our overarching mission of promoting health and well-being in an urbanizing world. Read more… In the coming weeks, you can expect more detailed information about the expansion, includingdepartment names, leadership structures, departmental foci, and new initiatives that each departmentand the College will undertake. We encourage everyone to embrace this change with an open mind andan enthusiasm for the possibilities that lie ahead. Together, we are shaping the future of public health and what’s next at UNC Charlotte. -Dr. Jan Warren-Findlow “Dr. Jan” Phone: 704-687-7908 | Email: jwarren1@charlotte.edu |Twitter/X: @DrJanWF Click here to donate to PHS Recent News >> BSPH Student & Levine Scholar Kayla Walker Highlighted For Work At Campus Compact February 13, 2024 BSPH Alumna Makala Carrington (’19) Bestowed With Excellence in Leadership Award February 2, 2024 Dr. Michael Thompson Named Interim Chair January 26, 2024 1 2 3 … 100 Next » Achievement or Story to Share?

The UNC Charlotte Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog are primarily intended for use by currently enrolled and prospective students, faculty, advisors, and staff. The Catalogs provide an overview of the University’s curriculum, academic programs and courses, facilities, and educational resources. They also include University academic policies, regulations, and procedures; information about degree and certificate programs, including degree requirements; a listing and description of courses; and a faculty directory. Which Catalog Should I Use? The requirements specified in each Catalog apply to students who commence their studies at UNC Charlotte during the academic year listed on the Catalog and who remain in continuous enrollment at the institution until they graduate If requirements are changed, students may elect to comply with the new requirements or to remain under the requirements by which they are governed at the time of the change The choice to apply the new requirements must be declared by students at least one semester prior to graduation through their academic departments STUDENTS UNSURE OF WHICH CATALOG TO USE SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR ADVISOR How Often Are the Catalogs Updated? The Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog are published online annually in the Summer for the upcoming academic year. Although course offerings and academic requirements at UNC Charlotte are continually under examination and revision, the Catalogs are updated only once per year. This annual revision procedure helps ensure that users of the Catalogs will not find unexpected changes during their academic planning processes.

It focuses upon the forces that organize and structure societies and smaller groups, as well as the forces that disorganize and threaten to dissolve them. As a science, sociology applies an objective and systematic method of investigation to identify the patterns and forms of social life and to understand the processes by which they are established and changed. The study of sociology is attractive to students seeking a liberal education and immediate employment, as well as to those preparing for further study and professional careers. As a liberal arts program, it enables students to understand the social contexts in which they find themselves and the social forces that shape personality, actions, and interactions with others. As a pre-professional program it provides an excellent background for people entering social work, law, teaching, the ministry, journalism, planning, public relations and personnel services. It also provides analytical skills related to market research and program evaluation in human services, sales, management, and other business activities.

Resources for Niners Need Help With Food? Swipe Out Hunger Swipe Out Hunger is a nation-wide program that partners with colleges to help put an end to student hunger and assist those who struggle with food insecurity. Leadership & Community Engagement has partnered with Chartwells Dining Services, Auxiliary Services, Student Assistance and Support Services, and the Sustainability Office to bring this program to UNC Charlotte. Eligibility for Swipe Out Hunger Program at UNC Charlotte: The Swipe Out Hunger Program aims to provide students who are food insecure, and/or who are experiencing an emergency situation, access to healthy and well-balanced meals in our campus dining halls. To be eligible, students must be currently enrolled at UNC Charlotte.If you meet this initial requirement and would like to complete a needs-based assessment to determine your further eligibility for the program, please schedule an appointment with Student Assistance and Support Services by calling 704-687-0289.Swipe Out Hunger Jamil Niner Student PantryThe pantry provides assistance to UNC Charlotte undergraduate and graduate students that struggle with food insecurity. In 2013, the USDA defined food insecurity as a condition that occurs when people do not have enough resources to feed themselves. The Jamil Niner Student Pantry offers a variety of nutritious meals and frequently gives demonstrations on what meals can be made with the food in our pantry.Jamil Niner Student Pantry UNC Charlotte SNAP ScreeningOver the past few years, nutritionists and University leaders have realized that emerging adults (those between the ages of 18-24 years) struggle to get enough healthy food. Federal programs exist to assist with this challenge. A support program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides approximately $70 billion per year to assist with nutrition. This program — sometimes referred to as “food stamps” or EBT — is administered by state and local governments. In North Carolina, this program is called Food and Nutrition Services (FNS).Here at UNC Charlotte, we believe that there are a number of students that may benefit from this nutrition assistance program. To see if you may be eligible students and faculty from the Department of Public Health Sciences created the following screening tool and application instructions for interested students. The template and examples highlighted below are based on the Coordinated SNAP Outreach process originally developed by Rebecca Leighton at Boynton Health at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.If you apply and are found eligible you will get a debit card in the mail that will be loaded with money each month that you can use for food. The amount of money will depend on your income and household information — we expect the amount to be somewhere between $15 to $125 per month. Before you jump to Step 1, please note the following:When answering the screener questions use your current living situation. For example, you might live with your parents in the summer and during university breaks, but if you are living in an off-campus apartment at the time you complete this screener, answer the questions based on your apartment living situation. Residents of North Carolina complete a county SNAP/FNS application (discussed in item #3 below) for the county in which they reside at the time of their application completion. If you are living in Charlotte during the school year, you are considered a Charlotte-Mecklenburg resident. If you currently live outside of North Carolina (ex. You live in SC but commute to UNC Charlotte), the UNC Charlotte SNAP Screener will indicate if you are likely or unlikely eligible for SNAP, but when you try to actually apply for SNAP benefits, you’ll need to click here for details regarding SNAP services in your state of residence. If you complete the SNAP/FNS application and are approved, a SNAP debit card will be sent to you in the mail. At that time, you will have a certain amount of money added to your SNAP card once a month for 6-months. You would need to re-certify after 6 months. DirectionsComplete Step 1 below to see if you are likely eligible for SNAP. Complete the Mecklenburg County Screener in Step 2 if the UNC Charlotte Screener indicates that you are likely eligible for SNAP before completing the actual SNAP application. To apply for SNAP benefits, use the link in Step 3.Step 1Complete this brief 3-4 question UNC Charlotte SNAP Screener to help assess your eligibility.Step 2Watch this video once you complete the screening tool. If you want to assess your eligibility in more detail, complete the Mecklenburg County Screener. Otherwise go directly to the application.Minute Markers for the video: 0:00 - 3:25 (Walkthrough of Mecklenburg County Screener) 3:25-15:21 (End) (Walkthrough of SNAP/FNS Application) Step 3Click for Mecklenburg County Screener and the SNAP/FNS ApplicationThis screening tool was developed by the state of North Carolina and is specific to Mecklenburg County residents.You should hear back about your results in the next 30 days. If you receive SNAP benefits, please use this link to access retail locations where you can use your SNAP card in your area. You may also use the map feature to see these locations, including those near campus. Note: At this time there are no current food vendors on UNC Charlotte’s campus that offer SNAP benefits.

Congratulations to the FALL 2023 Student Teacher of the Year! Tori Smith – Fall 2023 Student Teacher of the Year Tori Smith is an Elementary Education resident candidate who completed student teaching at Pinewood Elementary in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. As a resident, Tori completed student teaching while balancing the unique demands of being a full-time teacher and a student in the graduate certificate program here at UNC Charlotte. In the words of her Principal, Natashia Pegram, “It is evident that she is truly called to be a teacher. She establishes authentic, positive, and supportive rapport with her students…She is hardworking, persevering, and committed to giving her students and team whatever they need to be successful. She is a model for her fellow teachers, students, and families on how to continue to go after a personal goal and continue to develop in her craft.” We are proud of Tori and are delighted to have her representing the Cato College of Education as our Fall 2023 Student Teacher of the Year. Congratulations to the Spring 2023 Outstanding Clinical Educator! Justin Armstrong Carmel Middle School: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools On Thursday, April 27 the Cato College of Education presented Justin Armstrong, a special education teacher at Carmel Middle School in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, with the Spring 2023 Outstanding Clinical Educator Award. Mr. Armstrong was nominated by Drs. Ann Jolly and Jared Thompson. Dr. Thompson is the principal at Carmel Middle School and Dr. Jolly is the University Supervisor to Mr. Armstrong’s student teacher. Dr. Thompson and Dr. Jolly had this to say about Mr. Armstrong: “Justin Armstrong has been phenomenal in coaching his student teacher as a sixth grade Exceptional Children’s teacher. Additionally, and just as important, it’s been amazing to witness Mr. Armstrong model how he advocates for students and differentiates support based upon individual need. The warmth, compassion, empathy, and collaboration that Mr. Armstrong models is an invaluable experience for someone transitioning into a career in education.” “Beginning with the initial meeting and continuing throughout the semester, Mr. Armstrong provided the student teacher with a variety of experiences, in pull-out and co-taught settings. Mr. Armstrong welcomed a student teaching candidate with strong content knowledge and experience tutoring into his classroom and helped his candidate learn how to use these assets as a special education teacher.” Contact us Office of Schools and Community Partnerships UNC CharlotteCato College of Education Building9201 University City Blvd.Charlotte, NC 28223-0001 (704) 687-8802oscp-coed@charlotte.edu Quick Links Building Directions OSACP Quarterly Newsletter Interested in Teaching?

       "  'Classroom Communication on AI Tools – The Center for Teaching and Learning Skip to Main Content Classroom Communication on AI Tools CLassroom Communication on AI Tools Note that use of the acronym “AI” in this guide refers to “artificial intelligence.” When referring to “academic integrity,” the phrase will be spelled out. What this Guide IS and is NOT This guide is designed to provide you with flexible guidelines for the pedagogical and ethical use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in your course. It is focused on how to support the use of AI as a tool, by educating students on the parameters of AI platforms. This guide is not anti-AI, nor is it prescribing the use of AI. This guide does NOT provide or use a university-created policy on AI. Rather, it has been developed from (1) understanding of high impact educational practices, and (2) effective and appropriate uses of AI within courses. Communicating with Students about AI The following recommendations are intended to include but also transcend AI tools. They also apply to future tools that may have a significant impact on the learning environment. The practices described will assist in tool-proofing your courses by building a culture of learning, where students come to understand the value of honest work for their future careers. Establish a culture of learning Establishing a culture of learning will tool-proof your course content. When learning environments are designed with students in mind, and the communication reflects the care and effort to create impactful learning, then students will respond with respect, and value their assignments. Set clear expectations Leaving room open for interpretation leaves room open for real misunderstandings or claimed misunderstandings. Add AI guidelines directly into your syllabus (see teaching guide on: Syllabus Guidelines for AI tools) Communicate the role and impact of AI tools in the learning process within your course. Expectations may change from course to course Start with trust. Build respect Avoid the frequency illusion (or recency bias) that all students want to cheat, are lazy, or apathetic. Assuming your students will use it in a negative way before it will happen, will end up a self-fulfilling prophecy as they feel the respect and relationship isn’t there from the beginning. Demonstrate the benefits and limitations of AI Tools This shows that you are making parameters around AI not out of fear, but out of thoughtfulness. It builds trust and confidence with students by showing that you have put in the time to understand the basics of AI. It also makes it more visible that you would recognize improper use than someone who doesn’t understand it and therefore bans it. Support learners in developing ethical AI practices Model the use of AI tools in your context. Provide opportunities for students to critique AI output that include AI hallucinations and inaccurate sources of information. Regularly promote fact checking and source examination of AI generated content. Provide and regularly discuss this or a similar Student-Use Protocol for the Ethical Use of AI Tools. Most of all: Prepare yourself. Use Generative AI in your own work to learn its benefits and limitations. Detection Tools To date, there is no detection tool that is 100% accurate. TurnItIn The plagiarism detection tool available through UNC Charlotte, recently added an artificial intelligence detection tool. Think of these as a way to start a conversation about your concerns versus “slam dunk” evidence. SimCheck Reminder If you plan to use SimCheck to analyze student assignments, you must have students sign the appropriate waiver form. If you are using a different plagiarism detection tool, there is a generic waiver. More information is available at under suggested syllabus policies. Addressing Suspected Misuse of AI Tools Before you begin to navigate the misconduct process or reach out to the student: Step 1: Ask yourself a few questions What do I believe happened? What evidence do I have to support this claim? Are there other reasonable explanations? Is this behavior outlined in my course expectations or syllabus as unauthorized or not permitted? Step 2: Think about how you want to approach the conversation Accusatory language can shut down the conversation before it starts. Communicate that you have a concern: Example language: I have some concerns about your [academic exercise] that I’d like to talk with you about. I am available ____. Do any of these times work for you? It is important that we meet soon to discuss these concerns. Step 3: As you approach the conversation, think about what you need to know, to determine if a violation of policy has occurred. Open Ended Questions: Talk to me about how you approached this assignment. Tell me about this portion. How did you come to that conclusion/get that solution? Can you explain this paragraph? What resources did you use and how did you incorporate them into your work? I found it interesting that ______. Can you further expand on this? Direct Questions: Your assignment references concepts and vocabulary we do not cover in this course. Did you use an online translator to complete this assignment? Your paper reads differently from your past work. Did you use an online generator to complete this assignment? Step 4: Contact the Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution (SACR) to see if the student has any prior violations. Email accountability@charlotte.edu and include the student’s name and their student ID#. Alternative Contact: Call 704-687-0336 from a university provided phone number. Due to FERPA, the SARC office will not release student information if someone calls from a non-university number (like a cell phone). Additional Resources from the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution Guidelines for having conversations about academic misconduct (with instructions for adding Academic Integrity module to your courses for students). Code of Academic Integrity for the specific university policies around cheating and the language Processes for suspected academic integrity violations This teaching guide was developed by the Center for Teaching and Learning in collaboration with the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.',\n",

       "  'AI Ethics In The Data Science Classroom – Health Informatics and Analytics Skip to Main Content Apply Now Contact Us AI Ethics In The Data Science Classroom October 12, 2020 Categories:Department NewsTags:Department News Automated resume screeners eliminating female candidates, facial recognition tools missing black faces and crime predictions determined by the neighborhood, not by the individual. These are just a few examples of the challenges and consequences that have emerged from the growth and development of artificial intelligence and machine learning models. These issues have raised many ethical questions around fairness and justice, and how data science teams must consider the moral and ethical dimensions of their work prior to the development and implementation of AI and machine learning algorithms, and throughout their use of these technologies. Anaconda, a data science software company, recently conducted a study with more than 2,000 data science students, academics and professionals. It revealed that only 15% of instructors taught AI ethics, and only 18% of students reported learning about the subject. When UNC Charlotte established the first School of Data Science in the Carolinas and the only Bachelor’s of Science in Data Science program in the state, leaders behind the endeavour promised to do things differently. As an interdisciplinary program rooted in a four-college partnership, a commitment was made to incorporate liberal arts and science principles into a traditionally math and computing heavy major. “One hundred percent of our data science courses at the undergraduate level address the ethical issues in data science,” said Dr. Angela Berardinelli, senior lecturer for the College of Computing and Informatics and the School of Data Science. “Other programs tend to offer a single elective on ethics or create a module within an introductory or advanced course.” The major will not only inform students about data ethics in the classroom, but will also enable them to engage with community partners to observe the impact of data, privacy, and their work in real life. “Ethics in data science shouldn’t be just a ‘one-time’ thing,” said Dr. Andrea Pitts, assistant professor of philosophy and graduate program director for the M.A. in Ethics and Applied Philosophy in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “This is what I really like about the work that [SDS Executive Director] Doug Hague and my colleagues who are developing these courses are doing. They comprehend that ethics plays a vital role in everything a data scientist does, and understand the potentially harmful consequences of not addressing the ethical implications behind our work.” Learning objectives surrounding ethics are folded in throughout the major. Students in the major begin with the basics of data ethics, gradually adding the evaluation of ethical debates and arguments, finally, they conclude by learning how to conduct and complete an ethical audit of real-world scenarios within data science. “Not only will our students be able to identify the negative implications of a given data-driven practice, but they will also discover new methods and opportunities for addressing the important social issues of our time, including systemic injustices such as racism, sexism, and structural poverty” Pitts said. “The aggregation of mass data sets and the accompanying forms of data analysis that are now available did not exist just a few decades ago. Given these new techniques and the massive growth of data in the years ahead, upon graduation, we would love to see our students working in justice-oriented organizations to create real, positive change in the world.” To help share what they’ve developed, Dr. Berardinelli and Dr. Pitts are presenting during the American Data Science Alliance (ASDA) annual meeting on Friday, October 16th, and will shed light on how ethics can be integrated throughout a bachelor’s of science degree in a data science program.

The MSME program requires successful completion of 30 credits at the graduate level. Both thesis and non-thesis options are available: Thesis: The thesis option provides the students the opportunity to work on a research project that culminates in a published thesis. Non-Thesis/Project: This option exposes students to the nature of true engineering work in the form of a single project-based course, and introduces the fundamental tools for project execution that will be expected in the workplace. Further details on Master’s program options are available on the Degree Requirements page. Students must decide on their MSME option by the end of the second semester, through submission of their Plan of Study. Students have the flexibility of selecting their own courses with the approval of the graduate advisor. The faculty contact assigned at the time of admission serves as the advisor for the first two semesters or until a permanent advisor is formally selected by the student at the time the Plan of study is submitted. Research within the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science is focused in six primary areas – manufacturing and metrology, computational mechanics and materials, motorsports engineering, bioengineering, thermal fluids science, and dynamics and controls. Within these areas, students pursue a variety of research topics that address design, manufacturing, metrology, thermal sciences and fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, biomedical engineering, materials engineering and science, and mechanical control and instrumentation. Students are encouraged to consider the variety of research and their interests as they progress in their degree program, choose an advisor, and develop their program of study.

More than 500 students participated. There were 98 projects exhibited. 60 were first semester projects, 30 were second semester and we had 8 Civil Engineering projects. 68 of the projects were sponsored by an Industry Partner. Of the completed projects that were presented at the Fall Expo, 11 were picked as finalists for Best Project. These projects were determined from a combination of graded submissions throughout both semesters of the project, as well as recommendations from faculty mentors, grading instructors, and industry supporters. The 11 Best Project finalists were notified on the day of the Expo. During the showcase, these projects were scored by a team of independent judges to determine the best project. The top three projects were recognized at the Expo. There was also a competition for the Best Project Video. There were 10 finalists and the top three team videos were played on the Arena video board. There were 12 finalists for Best Project Poster. This is a contest for the first semester students.

Download \"shaping What\\'s Next\" Glossary of Terms The \"Charlotte Model\" is the term used in this strategic plan for the operationalization and communication of the University’s transformative, comprehensive, equitable and integrated educational experience. The \"Charlotte Model\" will include elements described in goals within the focus area \"Transform students’ lives through educational opportunity and excellence.\" The model also will incorporate themes from other goals in the strategic plan, including \"Advance the research mission by recruiting, nurturing and retaining, world-class, diverse faculty, staff and students\"; \"Fulfill our role as North Carolina’s urban research university to benefit our city, region and beyond by producing transformative solutions to societal issues and challenges\"; \"Improve educational and socioeconomic outcomes for the Charlotte region by mobilizing University resources and community collaborations\"; \"Demonstrate leadership in diversity, equity and inclusion\"; and \"Elevate and broaden student, alumni, faculty and staff engagement, investment and lifelong pride in the University.\" High-impact learning practices (HIPs) support deep learning by promoting student engagement. Research shows that HIPs significantly increase retention and success to graduation across all disciplines. Practices include problem-based learning, cohort models, first-year seminars and experiences, common intellectual experiences, writing-intensive courses, collaborative assignments and projects, internships, service-learning, and capstone courses and projects. Key elements include performance expectations set at appropriately high levels; interactions with faculty and peers about substantive matters; frequent, timely and constructive feedback; periodic structured opportunities to reflect and integrate learning; and public demonstration of competence. Kuh, G.D. (2008). Excerpt from High-Impact Educational Practices: What They Are, Who Has Access to Them, and Why They Matter. Association of American Colleges and Universities, 14(3), 28-29. Co-curricular refers to activities, programs, internships and learning experiences that promote personal development and complement, in some way, what students are learning in school — i.e., experiences that are connected to or mirror the academic curriculum. Co-curricular activities are typically, but not always, defined by their separation from academic courses. Great Schools Partnership. (2013, October 22). Co-curricular. Community engagement occurs when academics and community partners work collaboratively with and through groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interest or similar situations to address issues affecting the well-being of partners. At an urban university, it includes experiential learning in a community environment as well as programs of research and scholarship (community-engaged research) that are distinguished by relying on the priorities and authority of both the researchers and community stakeholders to shape the design and execution of the research. The translation and application of outcomes are evident in community impact as well as traditional modes of dissemination for academic research, scholarship and creative activity. Adapted from a definition originally offered in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1997), Principles of Community Engagement. (1st ed.).

Los Angeles, California: Research Universities and Civic Engagement Network; and from Emily M. Janke. (2013).

Adaptive learning is a technique for providing personalized learning that aims to provide efficient, effective and customized learning paths to engage each student. Adaptive learning systems use a data-driven — and in some cases, non-linear — approach to instruction and remediation. They dynamically adjust to student interactions and performance levels, delivering content in an appropriate sequence that individual learners need at specific points to make progress. Moskal, P., Carter, D., Johnson, D., (2017, January 4). 7 Things You Should Know about Adaptive Learning. EDUCAUSE. Universal design for learning (UDL) is a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn. UDL guidelines offer a set of concrete suggestions that can be applied to any discipline or domain to ensure that all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities. Guidelines include providing multiple means of engagement (affective networks, the “WHY” of learning), providing multiple means of representation (recognition networks, the “WHAT” of learning, and providing multiple means of action and expression (strategic networks, the “HOW” of learning). Cast. (n.d.). About Universal Design for Learning. Emerging top-tier university is a term that The University of North Carolina at Charlotte uses to indicate the pathway undertaken by the institution to rise in prestige and prominence from a nationally competitive research university to world-class status with a national brand that engenders recognition and visibility. The term encompasses the robust ambitions of the university to produce world-class basic and solution-oriented research, innovative scholarship and esteemed creative expression by high-quality faculty. This work will be conducted in the University’s urban research mission and framework, which integrates with academic excellence and service to the region, state and world. Use-inspired research is basic research strongly motivated by the need to create knowledge or know-how to help develop practical solutions to address societal challenges. Use-inspired research may have significant potential to support downstream technological developments. In consortium of industry, government, and academia and similar partnerships, industry members help identify the critical needs that could be addressed by basic research. National Science Foundation (NSF). (n.d.). NSF industry-university cooperative research center (IUCRC) 20-571 frequently asked questions (FAQs): General information, 3. What is use-inspired research? Signature research areas (also known as areas of excellence) are existing and emerging areas of research excellence with unique distinction and future opportunities. These are broad thematic areas where the University has achieved a national level of distinction; and areas where continued work, future investments and new resources will significantly advance our research reputation, raise the profile of our research and scholarly programs, and accelerate our movement to top-tier research university status. The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. (2020, December). Research & Economic development: Areas of research and scholarship excellence. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary: Multidisciplinarity draws on knowledge from different disciplines but stays within their boundaries. Interdisciplinarity analyzes, synthesizes and harmonizes links among disciplines into a coordinated and coherent whole. Transdisciplinarity integrates the natural, social and health sciences in a humanities context, and transcends their traditional boundaries. The objectives of multiple disciplinary approaches are to resolve real-world or complex problems, provide different perspectives on problems, create comprehensive research questions, develop consensus clinical definitions and guidelines and provide comprehensive health services. Multiple disciplinary teamwork has both benefits and drawbacks. The three terms refer to the involvement of multiple disciplines to varying degrees on the same continuum. The common words for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are additive, interactive and holistic, respectively. Choi, B. C., & Pak, A. W., (2006, December 29). Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and transdisciplinarity in health research, services, education and policy: 1. Definitions, objectives, and evidence of effectiveness. Clinical and Investigative Medicine, (6), 351-364. PMID: 17330451. Urban research university framework is the placeholder term used in this strategic plan regarding the means for mission fulfillment and operationalization of the University’s role as \"North Carolina’s urban research university.\" The framework should entail the means for the University’s impact through goals and objectives in \"Drive progress for North Carolina and beyond,\" including sections detailing efforts regarding research partnerships, socioeconomic and educational outcomes, talent and workforce cultivator, intellectual contributions and collaboration with the region to honor its history and with underserved communities to foster educational success. Integrity and respect involve ensuring the highest academic, professional and ethical standards and a collegial culture that embraces different perspectives, civil discourse and free expression, where all University members are treated with respect, fairness and dignity.

UNC Charlotte Pride refers to the sense of ownership, enjoyment and deep respect by students, alumni and other stakeholders. University pride encompasses the advantages of a UNC Charlotte degree in the marketplace, the opportunities to support students and University needs, and the benefits of Niner connections, networks and community. UNC Charlotte pride is also about inspiring students, alumni, and administration to advance our institution, city, region and beyond. Harrell. G. (2020). 9 Reasons for Niner Pride.

The issue was co-edited by Dr. Michael Thompson, associate chair of the UNC Charlotte Department of Public Health Sciences, and Dr. Michael Dulin, director of the Academy for Population Health Innovation. “We were fortunate to include many colleagues and community partners as authors in this issue, to highlight our region’s big data strengths, and to give the issue a decidedly Charlotte flavor,” said Thompson. The intersection of technology and health is an important area in health care, and a strength at UNC Charlotte. The Data Science Initiative brings academia and industry together to turn data into knowledge, and knowledge into insight to see what’s possible in the new digital age. The initiative is home to the Health Informatics and Analytics Program, which trains students to advance the field through a thorough grounding in data science, system architecture, and health analytics. “The health system is awash in data yet barely ankle deep in information,” said Thompson. “New analytic techniques – deployed extensively in business applications – are an essential component to transforming our health care system into one that is more effective and efficient, but more importantly, one that is evidence-based, proactive, equitable, and value based.” Selected Contributions UNC Charlotte Faculty and Staff Leveraging Data Analytics to Advance Personal, Population, and System Health: Moving Beyond Merely Capturing Services Provided Dr. Michael Thompson, Associate Chair, Department of Public Health Sciences Dr. Michael Dulin, Director, Academy for Public Health Innovation Benefits, Pitfalls, and Potential Bias in Health Care AI Dr. Douglas C.

       "  'Graduate Program Information – Cognitive Science Program Skip to Main Content Graduate Program Information What is the Graduate Certificate in Cognitive Science? Cognitive Science is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding the mind and intelligent behavior. It brings together knowledge and methods from a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience. The Graduate Certificate in Cognitive Science provides an introduction to the conceptual foundations and methods of the field, including in-depth exploration of technical skills for analyzing behavior in human and artificial systems. The ability to understand, predict, and augment human behavior is applicable to a broad range of career paths, including data science, healthcare, software and interaction design, government, and education. Who may apply? The Graduate Certificate in Cognitive Science can be completed (1) by existing graduate students at UNC Charlotte who wish to add an interdisciplinary perspective to their main program of study, or (2) as a stand-alone program for individuals with an undergraduate degree. The stand-alone certificate is commonly completed by post-undergraduate students who want to prepare for further graduate study in a related field, either at UNC Charlotte or elsewhere. The certificate may also help prepare for employment in a variety of fields, particularly those which use behavioral research and/or quantitative methods to understand behavior. Prospective students are encouraged to contact the program director (Dr. Doug Markant, dmarkant@uncc.edu) to discuss how the program fits with their goals. What courses are required? Details about the program requirements can be found in the graduate catalog: Cognitive Science Certificate Program The Cognitive Science certificate requires 15 hours of coursework.

A learning community is a group of students with similar interests who take classes together and share academic and social experiences designed to enhance the first-year experience. While the program runs through the first academic year, the benefits you’ll receive can last throughout all your college years and beyond. Studies show students who participate in learning communities are more likely to have higher grade-point averages, are less likely to be on academic probation and are more likely to graduate on time than their peers. Plus, students say learning communities make their years in college much more enjoyable and profitable. Skip to toolbar SearchLog In',\n",

       "  'Manufacturing and Material Handing – Safety, Security, and Rescue Research Center Skip to Main Content Manufacturing and Material Handing Assembly and Material Handling Manufacturing partners are drawn to join SSR-RC as members to leverage and expand their investment in robots for automating assembly and material handling processes. The UNC Charlotte SSR-RC assists manufacturing site members to conduct multi-disciplinary research on computation-driven robotic and sensor systems to improve the safety, capability and well-being of their assembly and material handling employees. Using robotic devices for assembly and material handling not only reduce direct labor costs, but they serve to keep humans safe from tasks that are hazardous, physically demanding and fatiguing or just simply, tedious, strenuous to human workers. Human Assistance Due to the increasing demand to perform risk-filled tasks in Homeland Security, nuclear waste handling, and search and rescue missions that put humans in harm’s way, the use of robots is increasing and necessary. Operations in environments unfit for human workers For example, robotic assistance to human workers in search and rescue missions, mobile sensors to detect radiation, robot manipulators tele-operated/guided by human workers to clean nuclear waste, material handling, robotic assistance in building construction/inspection.

It provides instructional technology and technical support as well as pedagogocial support to the students and faculty of the Department of Languages and Culture Studies and the English Language Training Institute in the use of supported multimedia applications and equipment for language instruction. Center Hours Monday-Friday: 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.Saturday-Sunday: Closed Center Support To support face-to-face classes in the Language Resource Center Active Learning classroom, the space was specifically designed as an active learning classroom. Simulcast or ” ” is also possible using two remote-controlled camera’s and ceiling mounted microphones. Our main non-face-to-face LMS is Canvas, of which the LRC especially supports the language learning specific features – or what we turn into one, like Canvas Studio for webcam recording assessments. We also host textbook learning materials for the language programs in Canvas metacourses and support the use of the online components of the textbooks (6) in the language program. For recording audio we use a variety of technologies like Audacity. To support the translation program, we offer SDL-Trados, and to support the film-studies program, we provide the Adobe Creative Suite in our MAC-lab COED037. The Language Resource Center maintains a flim library and multimedia resources for the following programs of study and independent study languages: Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish. The LRC also maintains and supports resources for the UNC Charlotte undergraduate and graduate Certificates in Translating programs, the UNC Charlotte Certificate in Business Language and the Film studies program.',\n",

MISSION AND PHIlosophy The Peer Assisted Learning program’s mission is to offer students additional academic group study support lead by Peer Leaders, current students who have completed the course successfully. PAL sessions are facilitated by peer leaders who have been trained to guide students and apply course concepts through fun and collaborative activities that provide more practice in Charlotte's most challenging courses. PAL is not a “quick fix.” Therefore, it is encouraged for students to attend early and as often as possible to obtain the best results. Students who attend PAL sessions are shown to produce higher final course grades than students who do not attend. We are committed to offering high-quality sessions by continually training our Peer Leaders in professional development, teaching and learning strategies appropriate for group-study. What to expect from a PAL session: When you come to a PAL session, you should encounter a friendly PAL leader ready to help you practice and understand course concepts further in a comfortable and inclusive atmosphere. PAL sessions are collaborative in nature. You should expect to work in small groups, although you might work individually sometimes. PAL leaders are encouraged to utilize fun and exciting strategies to help students gain a better understanding of course material.\",\n",

No. As of fall 2020, GRE/MAT scores are no longer required (pending final university approval). However, submitting the test score still remains an option if you believe it would strengthen your application; for instance, if you had some low grades on your undergraduate transcript, you may choose to submit GRE or MAT scores to help substantiate your academic ability and potential. Can I begin the program in the spring and/or summer? The M.Ed. program begins each year in the fall. Applications must be received by the priority deadline (January 15) or secondary deadline (March 1) for consideration to enter the program in the fall. Students are not admitted mid-year into the program. Can i take classes part-time or full-time? Many students in the program are working part-time or full-time and thus may take classes part-time (2 courses each fall and spring) or full-time (3 courses each fall and spring). Summer courses, when available, can also help students stay on track to graduate in a timely manner. We do not recommend students take one course per semester because it significantly extends time to degree. Can I take courses in the program as a post-baccalaureate student? If the instructor provides permission and space is available in the course, yes. However, some courses (e.g. ADMN 6100, ADMN 8110) are intended for students already admitted to the program. Also, taking a class as a post-bacc student does not guarantee or help one’s admissions chances to the program. Priority in course registration goes to current program students and an instructor may ask that you drop a course if you are a post-bacc student and a current program student needs the course. Can I take more than 9 hours (3 classes) per semester? According to the university, a course load of 9 semester hours constitutes a normal full semester program for a graduate student. This is lower than the normal undergraduate load because of the extensive reading, independent thinking, and individual research required of graduate students. Generally, graduate students should not register for more than 12 semester hours during a semester. The program recommends that students start with a course load of 6 hours (if taking classes part-time) or 9 hours (if taking classes full-time) to see how they manage the workload; then they can adjust the course load in subsequent semesters if needed. Because the program requires 30 hours, it is very possible to graduate in a year and a half by taking 9 hours each long semester and one summer class. A year and a half (or more) also affords students opportunities to complete at least one graduate assistantship, internship, etc. that you can make you more marketable for positions in higher education after graduation. This is particularly true for students entering directly after graduation with an undergraduate degree, as graduate assistantships are among the best ways to demonstrate your readiness to enter a professional position once you have your master’s degree. Does this program lead to administrative licensure? No, this program does not lead to any licensure or certification. Visit the MSA program for information on becoming a licensed K-12 school administrator: https://edld.charlotte.edu/programs/master-school-administration-msa How can I find funds to pay for the program? Students in the program finance their education through a combination of means depending on their individual circumstances, including through scholarships and grants, employment income (part-time or full-time), employer tuition assistance (including for UNC System employees), and loans. The admissions application is not an application for scholarships, grants, or loans, which must be pursued separately by students. Additional information is available at: https://graduateschool.charlotte.edu/funding/how-graduate-student-funding-works I am currently in another master’s program. Can I transfer specific classes/credits to this program? If you apply and are admitted to the program, you can request up to 6 hours of credit to be considered for transfer credit if those credits have not been applied to another earned degree (i.e. you have not already earned a master’s degree using those credits) and the courses must apply to the program curriculum and be approved by the program faculty. I am currently in another master’s program. Can I transfer to this program? If you are interested in entering the program, you would need to go through the standard application/admissions process, as there is not a transfer process into the program. Is it necessary that I work in higher education or in part-time (graduate assistantship) or full-time role? All students in the program should plan to gain relevant professional experience in higher education by working in the field either part-time (graduate assistantship) or full-time during their time in the degree program. The master’s degree alone without relevant work experience in higher education is not sufficient to be competitive in the job market for positions in higher education post-graduation. Experience as an undergraduate student alone will not make you competitive for positions. UNC Charlotte and other local colleges/universities offer a variety of graduate assistantships each year. Learn more about this process here: https://edld.charlotte.edu/academic-catalog/med-educational-leadership-higher-education/graduate-assistantships IS it necessary to have a particular undergraduate major to pursue this master’s program? No; students in our program come from a variety of fields and disciplines. May I speak with a current student in the program? Yes, please let the program director know of your interest to connect with a current student by emailing higher-ed@uncc.edu My application is complete; is it under review? An application is not marked as complete until the Graduate School has received and verified all components of the application package, including recommendations, official transcripts, and test score reports. My GPA or test scores are too low. Should I apply? We review applications holistically, taking into account all aspects of the application package, including transcripts, test scores (optional), recommendations, statement of purpose, and resume. If other aspects of your application are strong and help balance out a low GPA or test scores, we will still be happy to consider your application for admission. what is the process of applying for graduate assistantships? Admission to the master’s degree program is a separate process independent of your application to graduate assistantships or any other work opportunities. Once admitted to the program, sign up on a Hire-a-Niner to search for and apply for open graduate assistant opportunities. We recommend you apply for all positions for which you are eligible as graduate assistant hiring processes are highly competitive. Admission to the program does not constitute a guarantee of an assistantship. Learn more about graduate assistantships here: https://edld.charlotte.edu/academic-catalog/med-educational-leadership-higher-education/graduate-assistantships What kinds of jobs are graduates likely to pursue? This program primarily focuses on higher education administration and those wishing to pursue administrative careers in colleges and universities in areas such as student affairs, academic advising/support, residence life, admissions, etc. When are classes offered? Are any classes offered online? Most classes are offered one evening a week on the UNC Charlotte campus with a start time of 5:30 p.m. Some courses are available during the summer. Many classes also include an online component that takes the place of several weekly meetings during the semester. Some other courses students might encounter (for example, as electives) are offered 100% online or may be offered at other time during the day if taken in other departments. In general, there is a strong face-to-face course component in the M.Ed. program. Will this program prepare me to teach as a faculty member in a college/university? No. If you would like to teach within a specific field/discipline, it is generally required that you hold a master’s degree or doctoral degree with at least 18 graduate credit hours within the specific field/discipline. For instance, if you would like teach psychology at the college level, you should pursue graduate work in psychology. There is not typically undergraduate coursework in educational leadership/higher education so this degree will not prepare you to teach undergraduates. The one exception is that higher education administrators often teach a general course (such as student success, first-year experience, university 101) in addition to their full-time administrative roles and a master’s degree is required but does not typically need to be in a specific field/discipline.',\n",

The Women + Girls Research Alliance (W+GRA) is a key part of these efforts, funding new research with seed grants and convening a diverse array of stakeholders to drive change. Powered by a team of community engagement and communications specialists, we facilitate partnerships among students, faculty and community partners to achieve social impact. Key Initiatives ✔ We’ve enhanced the insight from the Urban Institute’s annual City Walks with the internal reach of the City Tours sponsored by our former department of Community Relations. The result is a schedule of 15 City Walks, which will take place between April 23 and May 8. Through these 10 in-person and five virtual events, both community residents and Charlotte faculty will have a chance to gain a greater understanding of Charlotte neighborhoods. ✔ The Women + Girls Research Alliance (W+GRA) Convenings bring together researchers, community leaders and civic investors to co-produce transformative outcomes that improve the lives of women and girls in the Charlotte region. W+GRA’s Research and Practice Series of conversations provide a forum for exchange among researchers and practitioners on issues that emerge from the Alliance’s bi-annual Women’s Summit. ✔ The W+GRA Research Grant Program encourages co-production between UNC Charlotte researchers, community residents, and practitioners. The program supports emerging scholarship, largely from UNC Charlotte faculty that expands and elevates the voices of women and girls in academic research. We firmly believe that supporting transformative research leads to innovative solutions to challenges that impedes success for women and girls in the Charlotte metropolitan area. ✔ We are conducting a Partnership Inventory Campaign to better understand the nature of the relationship between Charlotte and the more than 1,600 organizations, companies and government entities with which we engage. The survey of internal and external partners will lead to the creation of a virtual “knowledgebase” that will allow campus and community partners to navigate these partnerships. Through it, we will capture data and insights that will help us “fulfill our role as North Carolina’s urban research university to benefit our city, region and beyond by co-producing transformative solutions to societal issues and challenges,” as called for in Charlotte’s “Shaping What’s Next” strategic plan.',\n",

The Literacy Education strand uses an apprenticeship model of teaching and learning, meaning that students are encouraged to work closely with faculty whose research interests, methodological approaches, and theoretical frameworks align with their own. Click here to lean more Frequently Asked Questions Admissions requirements and deadlines for M.Ed. in ALII? Students applying for admission to the Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention AND the M.Ed. in Reading Education programs must have: A bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, from a regionally accredited college or university Students who hold a bachelor’s degree are expected to have a GPA of at least 3.00 (based on a 4.0 scale) on all previous work completed beyond high school (secondary school). Students applying for early entry are expected to have a 3.2 GPA or higher. An online application through the Graduate School’s application system for the M.Ed. in Reading. A statement of purpose Transcripts of all college coursework attempted Official and satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), if English is not the applicant’s native language and he or she has not earned a post-secondary degree from a U.S. institution Standardized test scores are NOT required for admission (e.g., GRE, GMAT, MAT). Test scores may be submitted as an option by applicants to provide additional information or supplement their application. Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina. Below is an estimate of costs for our M.Ed. in Reading Education and our Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate programs as of Feb. 2022: ALII Certificate Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $3,364.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $6,256.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate Master’s of Reading Education Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $9,252.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $17,203.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Reading Education, M.Ed. What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program. We strongly encourage students starting the program to begin their first summer taking one or two courses. This lightens the courseload during the second Summer from 9 hours to 6 or 3 hours. The courses for the master’s with the semesters they are offered typically include: Summer READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELL READ 6300 Global Literacy in a Multicultural World: Genre Studies RSCH 6101 Educational Research Methods Fall READ 6100 Trends and Issues in Literacy and Leadership READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy Spring READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction EDUC 6254 Individualizing Instruction for Diverse Learners Fall ELED 6303 Teacher Inquiry and Data Analysis in the Elementary Classroom READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing Spring (final term) READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading READ 6254 Collaborative Leadership in Literacy Education We develop an Early Entry plan that is individualiized for each of our undergraduates who begins the Masters program while an undergraduate so early entry students do not follow the cohort sequence. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate Course Sequence Students in the 12-hour certificate program take READ 6250 or READ 6255 and three other READ courses: \\u200b READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy or READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing — take one based on the grade level(s) you work with READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELLs READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading All coursework in the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate can apply towards the M.Ed. in Reading Education at UNC Charlotte for students who wish to go beyond the certificate and earn their master’s degree.

       "  'Research – GUO Lab Skip to Main Content Research My lab’s research interest is in the broad area of structural bioinformatics with a major focus on protein-DNA interactions. Protein-DNA interactions play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Knowledge of protein-DNA interactions at the structural-level can provide insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and can guide the design of novel therapeutic molecules. We aim to address several important questions regarding specific protein-DNA interaction: 1) what are the structural features for specific protein-DNA interaction? 2) can we model specific protein-DNA interactions based on knowledge learned from existing protein-DNA complex models? 3) can we accurately predict transcription factor (TF) binding sites with protein-DNA interaction models (also called structure-based approach)?

We seek knowledge with what different races/ethnicities struggle or succeed on the program’s writing assignments, and are interested in pursuing recent research on aspirational criteria for assessment that is being use to create equity in writing evaluation. As a gateway course, we believe that this work will serve to increase overall retention from the first-to second year for underrepresented minorities. Ellen Wisner – Biological Sciences Project Title: Creating Self-reflective Assessment Designed to Reduce the Achievement Gap Project Description: I became interested in and developed several reflective assessments aimed at helping students better see how what they were learning relates to their lives. For this project, I focused on Ecology, a course required for biology majors. I will develop and incorporate several short reflective writing assessments into my Ecology class. I will also evaluate whether these assessments help students succeed. This will be done by dividing the course into two groups where one group completes the reflective writing assignments and the other group completes a non-reflective writing assignment. In addition to examining final course grade, I will also survey the students to determine how their perspective on the course content changes as a result of the reflective writing assignments. This data will be collected with a pre- and post- course survey where students indicate their perceived importance and interest in various topics taught in the course. Monika Sawhney – Public Health Sciences Project Title: Diverse Populations in Foundations of Global Health Project Description: Foundations of Global Health is a course open for students across the University. Diverse groups of students ranging from sophomore through juniors, first-generation, and health care majors enroll in this course. This is also a high enrollment class. I am seeking ways to diversify assignments that cater to the learnings and academic growth of a diverse student populations in large enrollment courses. By participating in this opportunity, I will be able to revisit the available data, explore possible interventions, and implement appropriate interventions. Michael Smalenberger – Mathematics & Statistics Project Title: Normal Random Variables Project Description: In statistics courses, the Normal Random Variables (NRV) is an important concept and is built upon throughout the semester but students struggle with the topic. I developed an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) which provides step-by-step guidance as students practice problem- solving skills for NRV. While results show that perceptions were generally favorable of the ITS, there were students who struggled with the NRV concept more than students in prior semesters who did not use ITS. I would like to investigate which students struggle with ITS and why, so that modifications can be made to the tool. Gradescope Track Melanie Harris – Biological Sciences Project Title: Advancing Student Learning in Microbiology Project Description: Fundamentals of Microbiology is not only an introductory course, it is also a prerequisite for nursing programs. The time it takes to grade activities or assessments for almost 200 students discourages me from spending the time I need on meaningful feedback. Gradescope is a tool that will allow for more efficient, consistent, and meaningful feedback. If I am able to provide feedback this is of quality and less time consuming, this may result in improved grades on end-of-module assessments. Also, statistical analysis will allow for adjustments to my teaching by showing me where knowledge is not as strong as it needs to be. Erik Byker – Reading & Elementary Education Project Title: Integrating Gradescope to help Prepare Teacher Candidates for EdTPA Project Description: EdTPA is a professional portfolio that consists of three comprehensive assessment tasks and narrative commentaries, which teacher candidates at UNC Charlotte submit to provide clear evidence about teaching quality. As an instructor for the Instructional Design class, we want to best prepare our teacher candidates for all the edTPA tasks since it is consequential for their teacher licensure. The purpose of this assessment grant proposal is to investigate the uses of Gradescope in helping to assess and give feedback to the teacher candidates on their edTPA practice tasks and to improve the design and delivery of the Instructional Design class in order to better prepare teacher candidates for edTPA. Sarah Birdsong – Mathematics & Statistics Project Title: Gradescope’s use in a Math Proof’s Course Project Description: Fundamental Concepts of Geometry is an upper-level math course which require proofs. In part one of the course, instruction is focused on teaching students how to write up their solutions. Part two of the course requires students to apply their knowledge learning in part one. Unfortunately, students struggle with how to read and apply the facts learned in part one and I cannot keep up with giving meaningful feedback to every student; therefore, many of the assignments are graded based on completion. The use of Gradescope will allow for timely and targeted feedback and demonstrate the proper use of geometric facts. Jacob Horger – Chemistry Project Title: Quality Feedback on Student Assignments Project Description: The organic chemistry courses have high DFW rates. To be successful, students need detailed feedback early and frequenly in the course. Due to the time required to leave quality feedback on student assignments, faculty may rely on assessment methods (like multiple choice exams) that are limited to testing lower-level skills. I have started using Gradescope in the last year, to collect and grade handwritten responses on exams. I would like to expand the use of Gradescope in my course to address some of the deficiencies in my feedback and track item-level performance on assessments. Evan Wantland – Mathematics & Statistics Project Title: Gradescope’s Use in a “Critical Progression” Course Project Description: Though Matrices and Linear Algebra is required of all Math majors/minors and many engineering programs, it is dominated by students from a “computing” or “computer science” related program. The course is deemed a “critical progression” course but has moderately high DFW rates. It is unfortunately common for me to see the same students making the same mistakes throughout the semester. Gradescope will help me enhance, streamline, and expedite feedback to students and gather information about the assessment tools I use.',\n",

Find Out on September 19. David Goldfield, Ph.D. presents the UNC Charlotte 2022 Constitution Day Observance A bitterly divided nation, an insurrection at the Capitol, growing disparities between rich and poor, Black and white, legislative gridlock, and a Supreme Court meant to resolve disputes now widening America’s deep fissures. Is the Constitution to blame? The short answer is no: these issues reflect the shortcomings of both our leaders and ourselves. But, in the oft-heard declaration that “We are a nation of laws,” the Constitution, as the supreme law of the land, has not provided a framework to help us out of this mess. To the contrary; the Constitution may be making things worse. Can we fix it, or will American governance become at best a muddle and at worst a threat to our republic? David Goldfield, Ph.D. will present “Constitution Day 2022: Do We Need A Constitution?” at 10 a.m. on Monday, Sept. 19 in the College of Education (COED) Room 065. There is no charge and the event is open to the public. Constitution Day is sponsored by The University of North Carolina at Charlotte College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology. Goldfield is the Robert Lee Bailey Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. A native of Memphis, he grew up in Brooklyn and attended the University of Maryland. He is the author or editor of sixteen books including two prize-winning titles, Cotton Fields and Skyscrapers (1982) and Black, White, and Southern (1991). His most recently published books are America Aflame: How the Civil War Created a Nation (2011), The Gifted Generation: When Government Was Good (2017), and The American Journey (2023). Goldfield is also the Editor of the Journal of Urban History, and serves as Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians, and as an academic specialist for the U.S. State Department. He is Past President of the Southern Historical Association (2012-2013). Goldfield also serves on the Executive Board of the human rights organization, The International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, and on the Board of the North Carolina Civil War and Reconstruction History Center. His hobbies include reading southern novels, watching baseball, and listening to the music of Gustav Mahler and Buddy Holly.',\n",

Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina.

What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program.

Students applying for admission to the Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention AND the M.Ed. in Reading Education programs must have: A bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, from a regionally accredited college or university Students who hold a bachelor’s degree are expected to have a GPA of at least 3.00 (based on a 4.0 scale) on all previous work completed beyond high school (secondary school). Students applying for early entry are expected to have a 3.2 GPA or higher. An online application through the Graduate School’s application system for the M.Ed. in Reading. A statement of purpose Transcripts of all college coursework attempted Official and satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), if English is not the applicant’s native language and he or she has not earned a post-secondary degree from a U.S. institution Standardized test scores are NOT required for admission (e.g., GRE, GMAT, MAT). Test scores may be submitted as an option by applicants to provide additional information or supplement their application. Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina. Below is an estimate of costs for our M.Ed. in Reading Education and our Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate programs as of Feb. 2022: ALII Certificate Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $3,364.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $6,256.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate Master’s of Reading Education Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $9,252.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $17,203.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Reading Education, M.Ed. What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program. We strongly encourage students starting the program to begin their first summer taking one or two courses. This lightens the courseload during the second Summer from 9 hours to 6 or 3 hours. The courses for the master’s with the semesters they are offered typically include: Summer READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELL READ 6300 Global Literacy in a Multicultural World: Genre Studies RSCH 6101 Educational Research Methods Fall READ 6100 Trends and Issues in Literacy and Leadership READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy Spring READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction EDUC 6254 Individualizing Instruction for Diverse Learners Fall ELED 6303 Teacher Inquiry and Data Analysis in the Elementary Classroom READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing Spring (final term) READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading READ 6254 Collaborative Leadership in Literacy Education We develop an Early Entry plan that is individualiized for each of our undergraduates who begins the Masters program while an undergraduate so early entry students do not follow the cohort sequence. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate Course Sequence Students in the 12-hour certificate program take READ 6250 or READ 6255 and three other READ courses: \\u200b READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy or READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing — take one based on the grade level(s) you work with READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELLs READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading All coursework in the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate can apply towards the M.Ed. in Reading Education at UNC Charlotte for students who wish to go beyond the certificate and earn their master’s degree.

Test scores may be submitted as an option by applicants to provide additional information or supplement their application. Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader.

We accomplish this by focusing on three core objectives: Faculty support: Producing impactful research and relevant courses in collaboration with community partners. Student purpose: Helping students align learning with real-world experiences to pursue their academic, civic and career aspirations. Community impact and assessment: Managing accountability systems that ensure University’s responsibility for its community engagement goals. Engaged Scholarship Website Key Initiatives ✔ We are conducting a case study on the Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure (RPT) practices of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences (CLAS) related to engaged scholarship. About five years ago, CLAS became the first college on campus to integrate engaged scholarship language into its tenure and promotion guidelines. Today, as other colleges and various departments consider similar guidelines, we have launched a study that will analyze CLAS’ RPT data as well as faculty perceptions of support for community-engaged scholarship. The results will allow faculty and administrators to highlight and enhance successes and strategically address challenges. If you’re interested in being part of the case study, contact Dr. Ryan Kilmer. ✔ We regularly host engaged scholarship workshops and trainings to assist faculty and administrators with strategic planning, research development and course creation. This spring semester we held two such sessions: One was devoted to helping faculty navigate new guidelines for registering their classes with a service-learning designation. The other was designed to assist department chairs and faculty leaders as they develop goals for their colleges’ strategic plans, which are due this semester. Our biennial Engaged Scholarship Symposium provides an opportunity for faculty and staff to engage their peers in conversations about best practices in partnership development and co-production of knowledge. The 2021 symposium examined four critical areas requiring greater intentionality in the university’s quest to achieve preeminence in community-engaged scholarship: curriculum, partnerships, research and merit. ✔ Our office has facilitated development of updated service-learning guidelines that more deliberately reflect best practices of critical service-learning. The process for registering courses for service-learning designation also has been simplified, with the hopes that more faculty whose courses are aligned to community engagement and social impact will register for the designation. This will assist students as they navigate their engaged scholarship experiences and improve our capacity to measure and advocate for the teaching aspect of engaged scholarship. ✔ We have contracted with Portfolium to develop a Community Engagement Pathway and Student e-Portfolio System that will allow undergraduate students to chronicle and navigate their various curricular, co-curricular, experiential learning and student-led experiences. The system will incentivize students to move along a continuum of increasingly beneficial engagement activities, from volunteering to research and internships. Administrators from academic affairs, student affairs, athletics, career services and other areas that connect students to engagement opportunities are assisting in establishing the system, as well as students who are advising on its design. We expect to test a prototype for the e-portfolio system with 1,500 students this fall. ✔ We have begun coordinating several efforts on campus that actively engage students in community activities into a Student, Civic and Community Engagement Opportunities to build greater collaboration, better support engaged scholarship experiences, and more effectively advocate for this work.

They do good work while they work for me and then go on to do cool things after they move on from the research group. Kyle Stahler is no exception. An avid woodworker, he has cranked out some exciting pieces since graduating back in May. If you are interested in more of his work, the best way to catch him is camberwoodworking@gmail.com. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a comment UMERC 2023 Conference Posted on December 5, 2023 by Wesley Williams The first part of October saw me travel to Durham, New Hampshire with Nils for the University Marine Energy Research Community 2023 Conference. The last time I was at UNH was for tank testing during the pandemic, so it was nice to see a more lively campus this time. As expected the Atlantic Marine Energy Center (AMEC) and Pacific Ocean Energy Trust (POET) were excellent hosts for the event. Before making our way to UNH, Nils and I stopped in Boston for a tour of PTC arranged by Philip Bard. Philip graduated from the Applied Energy and Electromechanical Engineering program several years back and has been creating awesome demos that show the interoperability of PTC products that are used across the globe.

This topic is still focused on marine energy, but a shift from the desalination work we did in the Waves to Water Competition. In this competition, Landon and I partnered with Michael Dickey at NC State University, who has done some exciting work with deformable double layer electrodes. These electrodes could be the special ingredient that powers distributed embedded energy converter technologies in the future. We are excited about the prospects for the technology and the chance to work with another NC Renewable Ocean Energy Program researcher. https://www.herox.com/indeep/teams Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a comment Giving thanks for Nils Posted on November 24, 2023 by Wesley Williams A crazy Fall schedule that included a fair bit of travel has me behind on posting to the website, but the Thanksgiving holiday is an appropriate time for a post about Nils Horneff. Nils joined Water Bros Desal in April as an engineering research assistant from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany. He came with a strong background in numerical modeling that we wanted to leverage to improve the rigor of our wave energy converter (WEC) modeling. Within a couple of weeks of his arrival, we had him helping craft responses to reviewer queries on our proposal to the Department of Energy for a 4-year project to do long-duration testing of a ruggedized version of our Waves to Water design. Beyond the WEC modeling work, Nils was also great a disseminating our work through technical conferences like the Appalachian Energy Summit in Boone, NC and the University Marine Energy Research Community conference in Durham, New Hampshire. I even had him pop in as a fresh set of eyes and technical consultant on my North Carolina Renewable Ocean Energy Program projects. Landon and I are thankful for the technical contributions that Nils made and the friendships that developed before Nils returned to Germany in the middle of October.

Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a comment End of Summer Students/Alumni Gathering Posted on October 8, 2023 by Wesley Williams We were glad to host students and research group alumni for food and games to welcome a new crop of research assistants before Nils has to head back to Germany at the end of September. This time I actually managed to capture a few pictures and one humorous exchange over the gaming table….Student 1: This game is purely random.Student 2: If it is random, why do the people with PhDs have most of the chips?

Our neighborhoods, schools, houses of worship, where we work, where we play, where we create – we shape them and they shape us. Beyond being a simple backdrop of our daily lives, recent research by the Opportunity Insights team, led by Raj Chetty of Harvard University, suggests that the places that enable cross-class friendships may have a role to play in improving economic mobility. This year’s Schul Forum Series will explore the spaces where we connect in the Charlotte region, asking how those areas enable connection or create barriers to economic connectedness. We’ll not shy away from what’s in the ground that makes connecting across differences difficult, but we’ll also focus on identifying actions that we can take to facilitate relationships. Join us for the first of our virtual Schul Conversations on Oct. 26 at noon.

That plan provides a strategy to improve social outcomes by organizing University resources, community-based research efforts, and community collaborations to effectively address regional needs through collective impact. The Civic Action Plan called for the University to: “Establish a centralized structure, with dedicated staff, to coordinate and support the University’s community engagement efforts and assess collective impact.” More recently, UNC Charlotte’s 2021-2031 Strategic Plan, “Shaping What’s Next,” reinforced this charge in directing the university to: “Fulfill our role as North Carolina’s urban research university to benefit our city, region and beyond by co-producing transformative solutions to societal issues and challenges.” In helping to lead the University in achieving these objectives, urbanCORE serves as the hub of UNC Charlotte’s engaged scholarship ecosystem, mobilizing, assessing and advancing efforts that connect the University’s interdisciplinary, urban research resources to community assets. The office operates under the authority of the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and is overseen by an Associate Provost. It houses several research and engagement functions, including the long-standing UNC Charlotte Urban Institute and its Institute for Social Capital, the Women+Girls Research Alliance and the Bonner Leaders Program. However, with a high-performing staff of some 30 engaged scholarship experts, community engagement professionals, researchers, policy specialists and graduate students, it is organized to provide support across the University, in service to the community, through three core competencies: Policy & Data Community Partnerships Faculty & Student Engagement \\u200bEmail: urbancore@uncc.edu Mailing Address:urbanCORE9201 University City Blvd.Sycamore HallCharlotte NC 28223 Street Address:urbanCORE9310 Mary Alexander Rd.Charlotte NC 28223',\n",

Gender pronouns, therefore, take the place of people’s names and are often used interchangeably without cognition. For example, you may find yourself saying, \"He took the dog for a walk,\" or \"She is best friends with Norm the Niner,\" these are some examples of how gender pronouns are used in everyday conversations. This is because our brains have been socialized to make associations with how we perceive someone and which pronouns we use. However, this could be extremely harmful.The IEE recognizes that gender exists on a spectrum and is not binary in nature. It is important to use the correct pronouns when referring to someone in order to respect their humanity. Some examples of pronouns are they/them, she/her, he/him, amongst many others and combinations of any and all.Many people use pronouns outside of she/her and he/him. The pronouns they/them are not limited to plural use and can be used to describe one person and not just a group of individuals. An individual\\'s pronouns does not indicate that individual\\'s gender identity. Regardless of one\\'s gender identity they have the right to use any pronouns that feel best for them. Misgendering someone by using the incorrect pronouns falls under the category of gender-based discrimination, especially if there is a pattern to this behavior. Not only is it discriminatory, it goes against the values of the mission of the IEE in celebrating and supporting the expansion of identities.Misgendering is part of a larger system of discrimination and oppression. It normalizes cissexism and contributes to disparate outcomes for trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people, including higher rates of suicide and disproportionate experience of bias related incidents.If you have experienced gender discrimination, please know that the IEE is available to support you. You may also choose to report the discrimination through BART, our bias related incident reporting form or through the Title IX Office on campus. Misgendering or misnaming by students, faculty, or staff is not acceptable and is reportable.Resources:Office of Civil Rights and Title IX: titleix.charlotte.edu University Policies:University Policy 501: Nondiscrimination and Procedures for Addressing Reports of DiscriminationUniversity Policy 406: Code of Student Responsibility',\n",

Below are statements and links to statements from other UNC Charlotte departments: The Department of Africana Studies issued the following statement: Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Jordan-Davis, Yahira Nesby, Tamir Rice, Aiyana Mo’Nay Stanley-Jones, Korryn Gaines, Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, Keith Lamont Scott, … and those whose names we may not know. Asè. As faculty of the Africana Studies Department, we say their names in honor of their humanity and to call attention to the intersection of Blackness, state sanctioned violence, anti-Blackness and structural violence. The above-named individuals among countless others – including those we lost during the Atlantic Slave Trade, Jim Crow terrorism, and the expansion of the carceral state – have all been taken from our communities as a result of colluding ideologies of violence and white supremacy. The collusion results in Diasporic African descended individuals living with perpetual structural violence. This must end! The Africana Studies Department is committed to the liberation of African descended people. As scholars and community members we commit ourselves to resisting militarized policing, the neoliberalization of public goods and services, lack of accountability from elected officials, and patterns of racial inequality in all forms. We stand in solidarity with Black protestors and allies who demand substantive change, the type of change that recognizes the humanity of African descended people, and the abolition of systems of oppression. We bring together our collective efforts to facilitate a dialogue on how as a community we engage in substantive actions to end racism and structural violence-violence that stretches beyond the institution of policing and what Angela Davis refers to as the Prison Industrial Complex, but that is also in our schools, our health care systems and even our institutions of higher education. To that end, we will host monthly on-line forums starting June 17 at 2 p.m. EST. To join our discussion, send your name and email to: africana _ Studies@uncc.edu. Join us as we do the work to achieve a more just and equitable society. The Department of Communications Studies has issued a statement that can be found here.

Research tracks included topics such as misinformation during the pandemic, measuring the impacts of COVID-19 policies, epidemiology of COVID-19, and megacity pandemic response in NYC. “Our research focused on mining and analyzing COVID-19 data to identify existing disparities, especially for our patients of marginalized populations,” said Sokphat. “My role in the project consisted of combing through the datasets to uncover insights, analyzing outcomes and drawing our final conclusions from the data.” The team analyzed a host of incomplete data to determine which states accurately collected and reported racial and disparity related data, with the goal of identifying the ties between marginalized populations and the social determinants of health, such as access to health care, access to nutrition and socioeconomic status. Their research reflects the inequities of the U.S. health care system among marginalized patient populations, highlighted by the pandemic. It shows that while linkages exist between negative COVID-19 outcomes and citizens from a lower socioeconomic class, there are different demographic factors that are linked to outcomes. “For example, the negative outcomes from the hispanic population are more so linked to their minority status versus that of socioeconomic status,” said Sokphat. “Essentially, any proposed COVID-19 solutions can’t be based on a one-size-fits-all framework. Rather, they must be tailored to each individual population that’s affected.” Sokphat jumped at the opportunity of participating in his first datathon after two hospital-based summer internship offers were rescinded due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “I still wanted to make my summer as meaningful as possible, so I thought ‘what better way than to help create solutions around COVID-19 data,’” said Sokphat. “Also, as an HIA student with the School of Data Science, I wanted to implement the newly formed skills I had learned from the previous semester.” While his team did not advance to the final round of the competition, they were encouraged to contact MIT approved mentors and partners to publish their research. “We believe that it’s extremely important to encourage health care professionals and the federal government to continue to collect not only epidemiological data around COVID-19, but also racial and socioeconomic data,” said Sokphat. “They’re all drivers of patient outcomes and it’s crucial to have as much complete data as possible if we want to find concrete solutions to COVID-19.” Learn more about the team’s findings by watching their final presentation here.

Fortunately, the Model Risk Management (MRM) framework emerging from the financial services industry may be expanded to include ethics. Models from various industries including resume screeners, recidivism models and healthcare payment models may be biased against various users or protected groups and have resulted in poor publicity for any corporation found to be using them. As data scientists develop methods to manage bias, MRM may be useful to document and ensure best practices are followed. My focus here is applying MRM processes on mathematical biases of a model; however, the MRM framework is also applicable when broadening to fairness and overall ethical implications of data science. In simple terms, MRM is a process that reviews and monitors model development and operations. It consists of examining data quality, mathematical soundness, quality of predictions, appropriate use, and ongoing monitoring, all through independent review and validation. In each of these areas, bias may creep into a model’s prediction. Data: If data is biased at the start (as most data is), MRM has checks and balances to ensure that as much bias is removed as possible through management of input data, e.g.-selective sampling, ensuring representative data, etc. Older methods of removing protected variables are still necessary, but no longer enough as other correlated variables will bring bias back into the predictions. Math: It is important to understand the implications of the mathematical techniques utilized while developing models. For example, it may be important for mathematics to show why a particular result was produced. Explainability, especially for models once considered to be black boxes such as neural networks, becomes critical to enabling some use cases and therefore required during validation and in production. Performance: When examining the quality of model predictions, MRM can ensure that not only is the full data set examined, but that understanding the outcomes for protected subgroups are as similar as possible. This may result in a detuning of the overall performance to achieve a more unbiased outcome. MRM should require debate and internal transparency to these choices. One item of note – while protected variables should not be used during development, they should be available during validation to determine whether bias exists in the performance. Appropriate use: Appropriate use is the case where MRM limits the reuse of models outside of the data and assumptions made during development. The reuse of models makes data scientists much more efficient; MRM ensures that this reuse does not cause ethical considerations. For example, does a model developed in Asia apply in the US where different protected variables are important? Sometimes the questions and checks asked by MRM are easy, other times not. Ensuring that the questions are asked and answered goes a long way towards more ethical models. Monitoring: One of the more important process checks in MRM is the monitoring of model performance as model performance will drift. This is true for both static models and those auto-tuned frequently although in the former, performance drifts and in the latter parameters drift. As models drift, bias tends to creep back into the performance as well. Adding a bias check as well as a performance check during model monitoring will enable redevelopment at appropriate times. Validation: Independent validation and monitoring of a model is a great way to ensure different stakeholders and viewpoints are considered. This can be done through a separate reporting chain as is common in financial service companies or at a minimum through peer review. Having an outside perspective prevents tunnel vision and provides some initial diversity of understanding. Best practice is to include validators that have different and relevant life experiences. Applying the MRM framework to its model development practices can help a company better understand and reduce the risk of operating models that may have challenging ethical outcomes. Adding bias checks and assurances throughout the MRM process is one step that can help data science practitioners develop and manage the bias and ethical considerations in their work.

This distinction. . .also strikes at the heart of how virtual reality (VR) can be applied effectively to activist work. Though VR may not allow us to actually walk in the shoes of another, it can give viewers embodied clues about what it feels like to negotiate the sociocultural, political, and physical contours of the worlds inhabited, negotiated, and reshaped by marginalized people. This is an important first step in affecting change. VR technology and filmmaking is particularly powerful as a tool for activism when paired with existing immersive, collaborative, and place-focused theories and methods.”',\n",

       "  'Integrated Silicon Systems Lab | Low-power Electronics for Ubiquitous Intelligence Integrated Silicon Systems Lab Low-power Electronics for Ubiquitous Intelligence Skip to content Home Papers People Home Welcome to the Integrated Silicon Systems (ISS) Lab. We are performing research in low-power analog, mixed-signal, and RF IC design; biomedical interfaces; and neuromorphic engineering. Progress in semiconductor technology over the last couple of decades has brought a wide range of applications within the realm of possibility. While transistors have shrunk dramatically, the physical size of electronic systems remains limited by power sources. In order to realize the next generation of micro-scale electronic systems, members of the ISS lab are developing circuit techniques to dramatically reduce the power consumption of sensor-interface, communication, and computation sub-systems. Our research projects can be broadly broken down into two application areas. Sensing Systems There is a growing interest in developing small wireless sensors to perform measurements where previous instrumentation could not be deployed. Examples include implanted devices to translate neural signals into control signal for prosthetic limbs, and devices to observe the behaviors and environments of small animals or insects in flight. Often, the power source is the biggest obstacle to achieving the size, weight, and lifetime needed for a viable system. To enable the next generation of ultra-miniaturized sensing systems, we are developing low-power circuits such as amplifiers for acquiring neural signals and wireless communication circuits. Analog Computation By using the physics of transistor operation, analog circuits can compute in a way that is both elegant and much more efficient than their digital counterparts. While analog circuits introduce errors due to noise, non-linearity, etc., some applications are quite tolerant to these effects. Machine learning (ML) is one such application. The naturally parallel nature of many ML algorithms also makes it well-suited to analog computation. We are building analog learning circuits that increase speed and reduce power in order to enable both large-scale and small-scale learning systems.

Student Employment Procedure for New Student Employees Before you start working, you will need to visit this Canvas link to complete your orientation and onboarding steps. More Information on Student Employment Federal Work Study Federal Work Study is a federally funded, need-based, financial assistance program administered by the Office of Student Financial Aid and the Student Employment Office (HR). This program provides eligible participants (undergraduate and graduate students) with employment opportunities in which to earn funds to help with educational expenses. There are several distinct advantages associated with program participation: Studies have shown that student participation in the Federal Work Study program results in improved time management skills, enhanced classroom performances, and more active involvement in campus activities. Student employees and their respective supervisors work in close collaboration to develop a work schedule suited for both the department’s needs and the students availability. The vast majority of work-study positions are conveniently located on-campus. However, the program also offers a growing number of off-campus, community service-oriented employment opportunities (America Reads/Counts). Regardless of the location, participating students gain valuable professional contacts, experiences and/or references in preparation for future entry into the job market. Students that participate in the Federal Work Study program would have applied for Financial Aid and have been awarded and accepted the Federal Work Study grant. Only those students that have been awarded the grant and accepted it are eligible to apply for and to work a designated Federal Work Study position. Students interested in participating in the Federal Work Study program are encouraged to submit their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), before April 1 to be considered for the program. IMPORANT: Completing the FAFSA does not guarantee eligibility in the program. International Students are not eligible for Federal Work Study Funding and are unable to work a Federal Work Study job. First time Federal Work Study students will be contacted prior to the start of the semester about how to view and apply for positions and notified about the required Orientation for Federal Work Study students. You will only have to complete this orientation once at UNC Charlotte. For more information, visit the Federal Work-Study page on the Student Employment website. Student Temporary Wage Student temporary wage positions differ from those associated with the Federal Work Study program in the following ways: Student temporary wage positions are open to any interested, and currently enrolled, UNC Charlotte student. There are no financial eligibility requirements that must be met to obtain a position of this type. Student temporary wage positions are funded exclusively from departmental financial resources (operating budget, grants, receipts, student activity fees, etc.). Hiring departments are required to list all student temporary wage positions on the University's student job website. Graduate Assistants A graduate assistantship is an employment opportunity designed for/offered to prospective or currently enrolled graduate students to provide degree-related, experiential learning and/or work. The major goals of a graduate assistantship are two-fold: 1) to promote a student's progress towards completion of a graduate degree; and 2) to provide additional resources to accomplish the mission of the University. This opportunity may also serve as an invaluable means of financial assistance and/or support throughout the duration of a graduate student's course of study. Graduate assistantships fall into one of the following primary categories: Research Assistant or Teaching Assistant. Individuals interested in employment as a Graduate Assistant must meet the following minimum eligibility requirements: Successful completion of a baccalaureate degree; Full admission to a graduate degree program; Current enrollment in at least six (6) or nine (9) semester hours (or equivalent thesis/dissertation research) depending upon the type of assistantship; and An overall undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better, or completion of at least six (6) hours of graduate degree work with a GPA of 3.0 or better. If you are a recently hired graduate assistant, and have never worked on campus in any capacity, you must: Sign and return your graduate assistantship contract within all established deadlines; Attend a graduate assistant orientation program; Complete all required employment paperwork with the Human Resources department or International Student/Scholar Offices (Foreign National Graduate Assistants) no later than your first day of employment. If you are a returning graduate assistant, in addition to the timely submission of your signed contract, you must: Work no more than twenty (20) hours in any given week in either your assistantship, or your assistantship and any other on-campus student employment assignment; Participate in all required evaluation processes and maintain satisfactory work performances; Maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 and make satisfactory progress towards completion of a graduate degree thorugh UNC Charlotte or other approved inter-institutional degree program. Note: The aforementioned requirements for 'returning' graduate assistants also pertain to 'new' graduate assistants. Graduate assistants are paid semi-monthly stipends on the 15th (or last business day prior to the 15th) and the last business day of each month. Graduate assistants are not required to complete monthly timesheets. For more information regarding your designation as a prospective, or current, graduate student and/or graduate assistant, please visit the UNC Charlotte Graduate School website. You may also reach their offices at: (704) 687-5503 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. EST Monday - Friday. Information for Parents The ‘university experience’ presents a wide variety of learning opportunities for your young adult. Whether classroom, social, or work-related, these opportunities represent huge steps in your young adult’s developmental processes in becoming an educated, functional, independent, and responsible member of the community. As a parent, you can play an important role in facilitating your young adult’s successful growth and development. Your best contribution as a parent may be made – not by managing your young adult’s educational, social, or work-life – but by helping him/her understand the tasks and responsibilities associated with success as a student or employee, and coaching them for effective, yet independent, problem resolution. Please keep in mind that their ‘university experiences’ are much more than educational, social, or professional preparation—they are lessons in 'life'. Please refer to the information below if your young adult intends to pursue on-campus employment opportunities: The University Career Center (Atkins 150) serves as the student’s point of reference for student employment information. On-campus student job opportunities are listed here. It is the student’s responsibility to seek, and secure, any/all on-campus employment opportunities. Full engagement in the job search process provides a valuable learning experience. On-campus employment is both convenient and a limited commodity. If interested, your young adult should initiate the job search process early and explore all possible avenues to secure employment opportunities. On-campus student employment opportunities serve as valuable building blocks in support of future job searches. If your young adult intends to pursue on-campus employment, he/she must present proof of identification and United States employment eligibility by providing the following information: for example an unexpired US passport; or a government-issued photo ID and their original Social Security Card, or official birth certificate. Please ensure that your young adult is provided access to all necessary forms of identification and that they fully understand the significance of safeguarding personal information. We cannot accept photocopies or pictures of their documents. The University strongly encourages the use of direct deposit as the most effective and efficient means of payment for services rendered. Please ensure your young adult is provided access to, and/or informed of, all personal bank account information and that he/she can provide a voided check at the time of hire. On-campus jobs are similar to any other type of employment. Students are expected to arrive for work as scheduled and to perform all work assignments as directed by their supervisor.

Grooms (B.A. 2016), currently a Ph.D. student in archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis, has co-authored a paper in the journal Southeastern Archaeology on the Poverty Point World Heritage Site in Pioneer, Louisiana. The article documents the speed and skill with which native North American foraging populations in the area three millennia ago could construct massive and lasting changes to their physical environment in the form of earthworks. “One of the most remarkable things,” Tristam Kidder, the study’s lead author says, “is that these earthworks have held together for more than 3,000 years with no failure or major erosion. By comparison, modern bridges, highways and dams fail with amazing regularity because building things out of dirt is more complicated than you would think. They really were incredible engineers with very sophisticated technical knowledge.”',\n",

Questions & Information Please email us at reading-programs@uncc.edu for questions and information. Frequently Asked Questions Admissions requirements and deadlines for M.Ed. in ALII? Students applying for admission to the Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention AND the M.Ed. in Reading Education programs must have: A bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, from a regionally accredited college or university Students who hold a bachelor’s degree are expected to have a GPA of at least 3.00 (based on a 4.0 scale) on all previous work completed beyond high school (secondary school). Students applying for early entry are expected to have a 3.2 GPA or higher. An online application through the Graduate School’s application system for the M.Ed. in Reading. A statement of purpose Transcripts of all college coursework attempted Official and satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), if English is not the applicant’s native language and he or she has not earned a post-secondary degree from a U.S. institution Standardized test scores are NOT required for admission (e.g., GRE, GMAT, MAT). Test scores may be submitted as an option by applicants to provide additional information or supplement their application. Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal. There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina. Below is an estimate of costs for our M.Ed. in Reading Education and our Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate programs as of Feb. 2022: ALII Certificate Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $3,364.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $6,256.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate Master’s of Reading Education Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $9,252.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $17,203.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Reading Education, M.Ed. What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program. We strongly encourage students starting the program to begin their first summer taking one or two courses. This lightens the courseload during the second Summer from 9 hours to 6 or 3 hours. The courses for the master’s with the semesters they are offered typically include: Summer READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELL READ 6300 Global Literacy in a Multicultural World: Genre Studies RSCH 6101 Educational Research Methods Fall READ 6100 Trends and Issues in Literacy and Leadership READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy Spring READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction EDUC 6254 Individualizing Instruction for Diverse Learners Fall ELED 6303 Teacher Inquiry and Data Analysis in the Elementary Classroom READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing Spring (final term) READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading READ 6254 Collaborative Leadership in Literacy Education We develop an Early Entry plan that is individualiized for each of our undergraduates who begins the Masters program while an undergraduate so early entry students do not follow the cohort sequence. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate Course Sequence Students in the 12-hour certificate program take READ 6250 or READ 6255 and three other READ courses: \\u200b READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy or READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing — take one based on the grade level(s) you work with READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELLs READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading All coursework in the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate can apply towards the M.Ed. in Reading Education at UNC Charlotte for students who wish to go beyond the certificate and earn their master’s degree.

Lee, Ph.D. Webpage Bioheat and Mass Transfer Laboratory: Research: Currently we are working in a number of research areas related to Biomedical Engineering Hypothermic machine perfusion preservation of livers for transplantation: With over 15,000 patients waiting for liver transplantation and over 1100 deaths a year as a result of organ shortages, there is a need to improve preservation of livers and new ways to expand the donor pool. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has the potential to provide better quality livers for transplant and reclaim marginal organs that currently are unusable. Currently, HMP has not improved long-term storage (>24 hrs) of livers and our group is investigating the cause of damage. Three subprojects related to this work are: A. Determining the effect of shear stress at hypothermic temperatures on endothelial cells in the isolated livers. Our group is able to machine perfused a liver on a temperature controlled microscope stage and image the sinusoidal structure of the liver with intravital microscopy. B. Understand the effect of shear stress on endothelial cells in a microshear chamber at hypothermic temperatures. Using primary cultures of liver endothelial cells we are using video microscopy to assess endothelial cell shape as a function of shear stress. C. Investigate the potential of reclaiming non-heart-beating donor livers with machine perfusion. Donors that experience cardiac arrest prior to removal of their organs experience periods of warm ischemia which make the organs unusable. Our group has shown that machine perfusion has the potential to reclaim and preserve for short periods these organs for transplant. D. Investigate the potential in preserving fatty livers by HMP. E. Collaboration with Carolinas Medical Center Transplantation Group and Organ Recovery Systems to scale-up HMP livers for transplants. Bioinstrumentation: Our group is finding that we need to build instruments for our research purposes and that these devices may have broader applications. We will continue to build such devices for diagnostics and imaging purposes. Selected Publications:Pegg, D.E., Rubinsky, B., Diaper, M., Lee, C.Y.

Through the CII, urbanCORE staff first facilitate discussions among corridor residents to identify a solution to a long-standing problem. They then bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from UNC Charlotte and a group of community leaders to make the proposed solution a reality. The prominent staff role in the initial phase makes this method unique. Through the corridor projects, community and campus stakeholders establish partnerships based on reciprocity and design economically viable and sustainable solutions that corridor residents can own. Get Involved You may have a role to play in the CII! Each corridor project will provide grant-funded opportunities for several community organizations as well as UNC Charlotte faculty and students. Working together, they will then develop recommendations and an action plan. We welcome potential grant applicants to attend our Corridor Info Session, West Charlotte Food Project Panel, and other events in the CORE Research Series. Corridor projects will be staggered to meet the grant’s five-year timeline. Each project will unfold in the same phases over 15-18 months; time frames are approximate. Phase 1: Define the Community Goal (3-6 months) urbanCORE staff facilitate community discussions with corridor residents to identify a shared community goal. Phase 2: Enlist the Working Group (3 months) urbanCORE coordinates the process of recruiting relevant community stakeholders, faculty, and students to collaboratively design a plan to reach the community goal. Phase 3: Design the Plan (6-8 months) Community partners, faculty, and students collaborate on a plan to realize the community goal. Phase 4: Finalize and Make Recommendations (1 month) The project concludes with recommendations and a plan the community can follow to complete the project. It may involve handing the building off to an agency or firm, applying for a larger grant, or other next steps.

Drawing upon the more than 50-year legacy of the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute, researchers and graduate students equip faculty, students and community practitioners to access, interpret and apply relevant data to address critical issues and policies. Lori Thomas is the Executive Director of the Urban Institute and the Charlotte Regional Trust Data. Key Initiatives ✔ The Charlotte Regional Data Trust and Quality of Life Explorer data platforms help community practitioners make data-informed decisions and foster research to deepen understanding of complex community issues. Managed by the Urban Institute and its Charlotte Regional Data Trust, the Integrated Data System is benefitting from a $4 million upgrade, funded by UNC Charlotte and community investors, to improve access and support for community practitioners, researchers and students, and to expand the number of data partners and sources. ✔ The Urban Institute’s Gambrell Faculty Fellows program, with support from the Gambrell Foundation, funds projects to research issues related to economic mobility in the Charlotte region. Founded in 2018, the program has supported 16 projects by 28 Fellows, and the program is selecting its fourth cohort of faculty fellows. ✔ We’ve enhanced the insight from the Urban Institute’s annual City Walks with the internal reach of the City Tours sponsored by our former department of Community Relations. The result is a schedule of more than a dozen City Walks, which take place each spring in April and May. Through these in-person and virtual events, both community residents and Charlotte faculty have a chance to gain a greater understanding of Charlotte neighborhoods.',\n",

Students in FIT will receive campus engagement activities, an array of support services, and tailored cohort pathways that are designed to promote a successful transition into UNC Charlotte. As a part of an academic- or identity-based cohort of your choosing, you will participate in a guided course and set of activities to help you transition successfully to UNC Charlotte. As such, this is not a one-size fits all program– each cohort is different. Why FIT? Each FIT cohort provides students with a better understanding of campus resources and provides community-building opportunities so that students know how to navigate UNC Charlotte early on in your university experience. FIT benefits include: Become familiar with the UNC Charlotte campus, its resources, and support services. Establish a sense of belonging on campus. Connect with opportunities to become involved and engaged on campus. Address the academic and career success of FIT students through sessions specifically designed for your preparation. Engage in workshops that focus on social issues and acclimation to the university. Learn how to utilize library resources. Network with other incoming students with similar goals. Match with a peer mentor before entering UNC Charlotte to answer questions as the you prepare for your transition to university. Develop strategies for navigating the rest of your experience at UNC Charlotte. APPLY NOW \\u200b FIT Specifics Through FIT, students will have the opportunity to move into your fall housing assignment 1 week preceding the fall semester. During this session, students will be enrolled in a 1-3-credit hour course, be assigned a peer mentor, engage with campus partners to learn about campus resources, and be introduced to academic support services and student engagement opportunities on campus. One week will be in person, synchronous and following weeks (if applicable) will be virtual. Each cohort is different and meets the needs of FIT students enrolled, and so the lengths of time can vary. At the conclusion of the program, students should be able to effectively identify and use library support services, demonstrate financial literacy in areas of financial aid, scholarships, and credit/debt, as well as demonstrate the value of peer relationships to support your transition to the University.',\n",

They are the first UNC Charlotte students to be selected to participate in the Silver Spring, MD, based program. As a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) asset, dedicated to enabling critical scientific, research, and health initiatives, ORISE offers fellowship and internship opportunities across the U.S. for graduate students in STEM disciplines, in an effort to expand their expertise beyond the traditional university setting. The two students selected as ORISE Fellows are: Michael Thuemmel, Health Informatics and Analytics,’19 Gabriel Fair, Data Science and Business Analytics ’20, Ph.D, CCI Both students were offered positions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as Risk Based Assessment Inspection fellows. This project aims to transform the drug quality review and inspections process, ensuring safe, effective, and high quality drugs for the public. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Gabriel Fair has been tasked with supporting the process for fast tracking drugs and treatments, such as Gilead’s Remdesivir. “This is a great opportunity to really make a difference in the world,” said Fair. “With the rapid development of COVID-19, we’ve been able to see how important the FDA is in drug development, approval, and risk management. The public needs the FDA, and I’m excited to be a part of it.” Throughout the one year contract, the fellows will rotate between four sectors within the FDA, gaining experience in project management, facilities management, database infrastructure, and more. “By combining traditional business practices with modern data science tools, we’ll be working to ensure that the collection of risk assessment data is streamlined and can be easily transitioned for drug trials,” said Thuemmel. “I’m looking forward to combining both my hard skills, like coding, with my knowledge of policy management to play an instrumental role in providing safe, clean, and effective medicines to the public.”',\n",

The TEACH Grant is a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina. Below is an estimate of costs for our M.Ed. in Reading Education and our Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate programs as of Feb. 2022: ALII Certificate Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $3,364.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $6,256.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate Master’s of Reading Education Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $9,252.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $17,203.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Reading Education, M.Ed. What is the sequence of courses for the Masters and Certificate programs? M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program. We strongly encourage students starting the program to begin their first summer taking one or two courses. This lightens the courseload during the second Summer from 9 hours to 6 or 3 hours. The courses for the master’s with the semesters they are offered typically include: Summer READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELL READ 6300 Global Literacy in a Multicultural World: Genre Studies RSCH 6101 Educational Research Methods Fall READ 6100 Trends and Issues in Literacy and Leadership READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy Spring READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction EDUC 6254 Individualizing Instruction for Diverse Learners Fall ELED 6303 Teacher Inquiry and Data Analysis in the Elementary Classroom READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing Spring (final term) READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading READ 6254 Collaborative Leadership in Literacy Education We develop an Early Entry plan that is individualiized for each of our undergraduates who begins the Masters program while an undergraduate so early entry students do not follow the cohort sequence. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate Course Sequence Students in the 12-hour certificate program take READ 6250 or READ 6255 and three other READ courses: \\u200b READ 6250 Emergent and Elementary Literacy or READ 6255 Middle/Secondary Reading and Writing — take one based on the grade level(s) you work with READ 6252 K-12 Writing Development and Instruction READ 6204 Teaching Reading to ELLs READ 6260 Diagnostic Assessment and Instruction in Reading All coursework in the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate can apply towards the M.Ed. in Reading Education at UNC Charlotte for students who wish to go beyond the certificate and earn their master’s degree. Students may start the ALII Certificate any term–Spring, Summer or Fall. The program requires three semesters or one academic year to complete.

Instructors can post the materials using online software, make copies of the materials and distribute these copies to students or place copies of the material on reserve in a library. Students will work with instructor(s) to determine an appropriate time frame for viewing materials. Alternative Text Some students require course materials in alternate formats. Common alternate formats include enlarged texts, recorded texts, electronic texts or brailed course materials. DS works with the student and the instructor to ensure that course materials are available in an appropriate format for the student. Depending on the specific alternative text format conversion can be a slow, time consuming process. Thus, a DS staff member may require that faculty provide course materials in advance. What is “Large Print”? Large print typeface is equivalent to 18 point font. Some students require larger than 18 point font, however. Requests for large print will be outlined as part of the student’s Accommodation Letter. Attendance Students with some disabilities, such as chronic illness or mobility difficulties, may miss class as a result. The student is responsible for contacting faculty EACH TIME class is missed due to a disability, unless hospitalized or otherwise not physically able. DS counselors meet with students to discuss the potential implications of missing class (i.e. missed notes, greater difficulty in understanding the material). The instructor and the student should discuss the specifics of a flexible attendance policy. In very rare cases an attendance accommodation may not be feasible. If faculty have questions about how an attendance accommodation would work with the class pedagogy contact the student’s DS counselor to discuss options. Braille While most course materials can be made available to students with visual impairments in electronic or audio formats, it may be necessary to provide key passages, handouts or diagrams in Braille. DS can provide limited Brailing services. Breaks as Needed For some students with disabilities, sitting for long periods of time and/or remaining in the same position for the duration of a class period can exacerbate symptoms of the disability. Similarly, some students may need to leave class for brief periods to attend to medications or other medical needs. DS encourages these students to move around or leave class in the least disruptive manner possible. Students should discuss seating arrangements and the timing of breaks with their instructors. Class Notes The need for supplemental class notes is appropriate for a variety of disabilities. When you receive a student accommodation letter stating that class notes are appropriate please make a generic statement in class encouraging students to volunteer. Disability Services sends an email to all students requesting a volunteer note taker in your class. Students are not eligible to receive this accommodation until the instructor has been provided a letter of accommodation. If the instructor provides a detailed class outline with notes additional class notes may not be necessary. Please reply to the email sent by Disability Services advising the office of your notes. Deaf and Hard of Hearing Accommodations Students with hearing loss vary greatly in the assistance that is needed to ensure access to class lecture and materials. Services are established after the student meets with a counselor in Disability Services. Whenever possible, faculty are notified in advance that an interpreter or CART provider will be in class. Computer Assisted Real Time Transcription (CART) is usually accommodated by an on-site provider. This individual types or “shadow speaks” information occurring in class into a laptop with is then visible to the student who sits alongside. Interpreters There are several different forms of interpreting that may be provided to a student with hearing loss. The specific type of service is identified during the meeting with the student and is based on the medical documentation. Interpreters typically stand in the front of the class to the side of the instructor. In higher level classes, interpreters may ask for a copy of the text so that they can ensure access to discipline specific vocabulary. Captioning Videos that are part of the class or are on the course syllabus should be captioned. Faculty should review videos prior to the start of the semester for accessibility and if not captioned, contact captioning@uncc.edu immediately for assistance. Frequency Modulation (FM) Systems are like miniature radio stations operating on specific frequencies. The personal FM system consists of a transmitter microphone used by the instructor and a receiver used by the student with a hearing impairment. The receiver transmits the sound to the ears of the student or directly to the hearing aid. Laptop in Class for Taking Notes Students who, because of a disability, have difficulty taking notes by hand may be eligible to use a laptop in class as an accommodation. Activities such as checking email, instant messaging, and other web related involvement are forbidden. Preferential Seating Students with disabilities may request an instructor’s assistance in obtaining appropriate classroom seating. While reasons for accessible seating vary widely, common disability-related requests include seating near the front of the room, seating near the board or overhead projector, seating near an interpreter or microphone, seating near (or away) from windows, seating near the door and seating on the entry-level of a multi-level classroom. DS staff can assist with any modifications to classroom furniture that are necessary due to an accessible seating request. Record Class Lecture Students with disabilities may require the use of recording devices in class to capture class lectures and discussions. Recording class materials in audio format is allowed when the student provides notification of the accommodation to the instructor. The student may discuss with the instructor the best placement of the recording device. Through the Office of Disability Services, students with this accommodation formally acknowledge that they agree to abide by proper use of the recordings as a study aide. DS can serve as a resource for questions regarding the recording accommodation. Can I forbid a student with this accommodation from recording my lectures? No. If it is an approved accommodation, it is meant to provide meaningful access to the educational experience and will appear on the student’s Accommodation Letter. The recording of lectures is one of the accommodations specifically mentioned in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The issue of copyright as a concern is referenced in this Department of Education document on auxiliary aids. Visit the Office of Legal Affairs website for more information on classroom recordings and FERPA in person and online classes. Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations (e.g. lower distraction environment, extended time, assistive technology, etc.) are perhaps the most common accommodations requested.

The Guest Access Portal grants view-only access to your records. About FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, is the US law that protects the privacy of student records. Read more information on FERPA and Charlotte’s definition of directory information under FERPA. University Policy 402 provides detailed information on how UNC Charlotte protects student records. View our annual notification page for more info. Already given access? Please Note: Due to a system upgrade on Sept. 16, 2023, all existing Guest Access Portal users will need to be re-added by their students. Students should follow the instructions below to add family members/guests in the updated system. Go to Guest Login Page You MUST have your passphrase if you call in to speak to someone at the University Guest Access Portal Information for Students Student Choices As a student, you may grant view-only access to a specified parent and/or guest using the UNC Charlotte Guest Access Portal located securely within Banner Self-Service. Determine If. \\u200bYou determine if you want to grant view access to your education records. You should not feel pressured to grant access to anyone. If you decide to grant access, your guest will have view-only access and will not be able to update your records, or accept any financial aid awards on your behalf. Decide Whom. You decide whom may view your information, and what pieces of information each guest may view. You decide what each guest can view by creating a separate and unique login per guest. You can update or change access at any time. Dictate What. You dictate what information your guests can view and how long they have access by creating guest access accounts and assigning access to specific information. Options include: class registration status, student class schedule, grades, unofficial transcript, and/or financial aid. Setting up Guest Access Only students can create guest access accounts in Banner Self-Service. Below are the instructions on how to set up a guest and select the information you allow that person to access. 1. Log in to MyCharlotte 2. Select Student Self-Service 3. Under Student Records, select Guest Access Portal 4. Select Add New 5. Set up a guest profile for the person(s) you want to grant access by entering the following information: Name and email of the person(s) Select “Guest” in the Relationship box Start/Stop date for access Description Passphrase* Select Authorizations, check the boxes for the specific pages you want your guest to access 6. Select Submit An email will be sent to your guest to verify their identity, create a PIN and login, and set up the relationship profile. Creating a Passphrase In addition to providing information about your guest, you have the option to create a unique verbal “passphrase” for each guest. If your guest calls to speak to any university faculty/staff about your records, the faculty/staff member will require the passphrase to validate the guest’s identity before providing authorized information over the phone. *Be sure to tell this passphrase to your guest! The passphrase only helps confirm the identity of the person on the phone. After confirming the passphrase, university staff will also check the specific information to which the student has given access for that specific guest. Changing Your Guest’s Access Adding: Students may add new guests at any time in Banner Self-Service. Updating: Students may update or change which information their guest has access to at any time in Banner Self-Service. Deleting: The university does not allow students to delete a guest. However, to stop access for a guest, you can change the ending access date. University staff cannot add or change guest access. Guest Access vs. Authorized Users for Student Accounts While the Guest Access Portal allows parents/guests to view your selected education records, it doesn’t allow them to make any changes to your account. On the other hand, Authorized Payers are granted access to your student account. They are permitted to view student account information and make payments on the student’s behalf. Authorized payers DO NOT have access to stored payment methods, academic records, or other personal information. If you want to add an authorized payer to allow them to make payments to your university bill, follow these directions: Log in to MyCharlotte Select Make a Payment/View Account. This will load the Student Accounts Payment/Billing suite. Select Authorized Payer, under “My Account” tab Enter in the email address of the Authorized Payer you want to establish in the “Add Authorized Payer” section. Select Continue button. Complete agreement and press Continue to confirm. Authorized Payers will receive an email informing them that they have been granted access to the Payment/Billing Suite. The email notification will include access information that will be used when logging into the Student Accounts Payment/Billing Suite. University’s Right to Review and Respond While the Guest Access Portal authorizes UNC Charlotte to release education records to third parties, it does not obligate UNC Charlotte to do so. UNC Charlotte reserves the right to review and respond to requests for release of education records on a case-by-case basis. For additional information, visit UNC Charlotte’s FERPA Information page or the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Guest Access Portal Information for Parents and Guests Parent Information All students have the right to protect their information. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, is the United States federal law that protects the privacy of student records. University Policy 402 provides detailed information on how UNC Charlotte protects student records. Under FERPA, privacy rights transfer from the parents to the student once they turn 18 years old or enter a postsecondary institution at any age. Both current and former UNC Charlotte students are covered by these rights. Conversation. Have a conversation with your student about how best to support their educational progress, which may include granting access of their education records with you or anyone else. The student/guest relationship and access is controlled by the student. The student can create guest user accounts and assign access to specific pieces of information to anyone they choose. The student can change access for his/her guest and can also choose to stop guest access to his/her information at any time in Banner Self-Service. Consent. Only students may grant access to their education records to a specified parent and/or guest using the UNC Charlotte Guest Access Portal. The FERPA law prevents the University from releasing “personally identifiable student education records” to unauthorized individuals or organizations without the student’s consent or other legal exception. Due to the FERPA law, university faculty and staff are NOT permitted to discuss any non-directory information (grades, academic performance or standing) without the student’s permission or other legal exception. Connect. Guest users, who have been authorized by the student, have the opportunity to connect to a student’s education records and view items such as class schedule, mid-term and final grades, unofficial academic transcript and financial aid. Requests for access to education records should be made directly to the student. Even without the student’s consent, parents can access student information in specific circumstances. For more about those exceptions, please see the Legal Affairs website. Viewing Your Student’s Education Record The Guest Access Portal allows students to grant a guest, such as a parent or spouse, access to view their education records in Banner Self-Service. Only students may grant access to their education records to a specified parent and/or guest using the Guest Access Portal. When a student adds you as a guest through the Guest Access Portal, you will receive an e-mail message with the subject line “UNC Charlotte Guest Access—New Account (Action Required).” The email contains this Guest Login link. Follow these step-by-step instructions for creating your PIN and viewing your student’s records. Guest Access vs. Authorized Payers for Student Accounts While the Guest Access Portal allows parents/guests to view the student’s selected education records, it doesn’t allow guests to make any changes to the student’s account. On the other hand, Authorized Payers are granted access to view student account information and make payments on the student’s behalf. Authorized payers DO NOT have access to stored payment methods, academic records, or other personal information. If your student wants to add you as an authorized user to allow you to make payments to their university bill, have your student follow these directions.\\u200b Guest Access Portal Information for Faculty and Staff Access to Student Records The Guest Access Portal in Banner offers students a simple way to grant parents/guests access to their education records. Portal. The Guest Access Portal is the preferred method to provide access to a student’s education records. Students create guest user accounts and assign access to specific pieces of information to anyone they choose. Guest users can potentially view items such as a student’s class schedule, mid-term and final grades, unofficial academic transcript and financial aid. Permission. The Guest Access Portal is NOT a blanket authorization allowing access to ALL the student’s educational records. Faculty/staff must check each student’s guest access names and the modules for which they have provided access. Requests to access student information should be made directly to the student. Passphrase. Each guest can be given a unique passphrase as an option to help you confirm the identity of the person on the phone. After confirming the passphrase, staff must also check the specific information the student has given access for that specific guest. Use the Guest Access Authorizations link in Banner Self-Service or GPAPRXY in Banner Admin Pages to check each student’s guest access names and the banner screens for which they have provided access. Two Ways to View the Passphrase and Specific Guest Access 1) In Banner Admin Pages, use GPAPRXY (For staff who have access to Banner Admin Pages)Step 1: Locate GPAPRXY form, and enter student ID.Step 2: Select Go or do a Next Block (Alt + Page Down)Step 3: Confirm the guest’s identity by viewing the Proxy Information section. Once the guest has confirmed their knowledge of the student’s passphrase, you can discuss only the information items checked in the Authorization List, such as the student’s Final Grades. 2) Use Banner Self-Service (For Faculty/Staff Who Do Not Have Access to Banner Forms)Step 1: Log into Faculty Self-Service on MyCharlotteStep 2: Select “Student Search” and search for the studentStep 3: Select “Guest Access Authorizations”Step 4: The next screen will show the student’s guest and the pages they have been granted access to view. Please pay attention to specific access per guest. For example, just because a guest is allowed to view a student’s midterm or final grades, does not give you permission to discuss the quizzes, essays, or other work that might have led to that grade. Student example: A student may allow one parent to view only their grades. For another guest, they may allow access only to their financial aid records. University faculty/staff need to confirm which parent/guest has access to which information before speaking to anyone about information on a student’s record. Also, the student can change access for his/her guest and can also choose to stop guest access to his/her information at any time. Therefore, it is necessary to check the Guest Access Portal for every time you speak to a parent/guest. We encourage faculty/staff to ask students to use the Guest Access Portal. However, if you are in a situation where you need to use the online form, it is still available here. Have additional questions related to the Guest Access Portal & FERPA? Check out our FAQs!

Data scientists like math! Nothing very surprising there. But as we go about our work building models and making great predictions, we tend to reduce the conversation about ethics into mathematical terms. Is my prediction for Caucasian Americans the same as African Americans? Female predictions equivalent to male? We develop confusion matrices and measure the accuracy of our predictions. Or maybe the sensitivity or the specificity is important, so we balance those for various subgroups. Unfortunately, mathematicians have shown that while we may be able to balance the accuracy, specificity, or other measures of bias, for real data sets, we cannot balance them all and make perfectly unbiased models. So, we do the best we can within the framework we are provided and declare that this model is fair. After studying the issues and applications, I assert that models that balance bias are not fair. Fairness really does not pay attention to mathematics. It pays attention to individual viewpoints, societal and cultural norms and morals. In other words, fairness is defined by social systems and philosophy. For example, in criminal justice, recidivism models predict whether a person arrested will commit another crime if released on bond. As an indicted individual, you believe that the false positive rate should be as low as possible so you are not kept in jail when you should not be. For the average citizen however, you want the false negative rate as low as possible to minimize the number of people that are let out and go on to commit a new crime. Balancing these two are a tradeoff that both sides will say is not fair. AND this does not even start to discuss the bias in the data and the system that has resulted in disproportionately higher numbers of African Americans being incarcerated. As one considers the ethical implications of data science, one quickly gets to debating the cultural and moral norms of the society that the model is being deployed into. As a data science team deploys a model, those cultural norms must be considered. Philosophies of utilitarianism and its derivatives are prevalent within Western society. Here, the role of overall good is debated and the balance between individual good and common good is discussed. Other philosophical constructs are favored in different cultures and geographies. Understanding how, where and what cultures a model will touch is important to reaching for fairness for the deployed model. Understanding the system within which a model is deployed is just as important. As models are deployed, they enter an operational system. Depending upon the specifics of the situation, there are often decisions that are made after the model prediction. Data scientists often develop and measure model accuracy based upon what mathematics predicts. However, measurement of the entire system and decisions that occur AFTER the model prediction is just as important. Additionally, human-in-the-loop models are often held up as even more accurate; however, are they also less biased and fairer? With a human in the loop, bias may creep back into decisions. Also, if there is not a single decision maker, different people bring different levels of information as well as cultural differences. Each of these differences can easily result in system bias and fairness issues even if the model was tuned and prepared to be as fair as possible. Framing the operations and measuring performance should occur for both the model outcome as well as the system outcome. I believe many lawsuits over fairness and discrimination occur because both sides frame the situation differently. Each side is “right” within their framing, but which frame will a jury conclude to be fair? As responsible data scientists, we should expand our ethical considerations beyond the mathematical bias of our model to include cultural and societal norms, and our model deployment should consider framing the outcomes of the system and not just the model predictions.',\n",

Through our Niner Character Promise, and with the help of our families, we seek to educate our participants prior to their program experience about the expectations we have regarding conduct and attitude while participating in our programs. During the registration process, we will ask that families registering confirm that they will review the following Niner Character Promise with their student prior to the start of the program. We will also utilize and refer to the Promise during staff training and throughout our programs. As a Youth Programs Participant, I promise to: Treat my fellow participants and staff with kindness, respect, and cooperation in my words and actions at all times and NOT use bullying words or behavior that disrupt the experience of others. Seek help from instructors or staff in resolving conflict especially if it is something I do not feel I can resolve on my own. Respect the property of the university buildings as well as other people's property. Notify my instructor or a staff member immediately if I witness a violation of this Niner Character Promise. What are examples of unacceptable social cruelty at UNC Charlotte’s Youth Programs: Teasing Exclusion Bullying Rumoring Ganging Up Is teasing ever acceptable? We recognize that when working with young people. Teasing does not always equal bullying. Teasing may be acceptable when these elements are all present: Everyone gets an equal share of the teasing within the group (one person is not being ganged up on). People are not making fun of someone's disability, ethnicity, faith, or other characteristics beyond the person's control. It is not repeated over and over again. It is not meant to physically or emotionally harm in any way. If you ask the person to stop the teasing, they will immediately. The teasing comes from someone you are close to (close friend, family member). Violations of the Niner Character Promise will result in a phone call home and could lead to partial or full suspension without a refund when deemed severe.\",\n",

General Information Name: Kim Harris Major/Graduate Program: M.S. Health Informatics (2015) Year Graduated: Doctorate Business Administration (anticipated May 2023) Hobbies/Interests: Roller Skating, Reading, Games & Activities Academics Campus Connections: While obtaining my master’s degree at UNC Charlotte, I co-led department student networking activities and became a charter member for the Health Informatics Student Advisory Board to extend the voice of our students to industry leaders. I also became a part of our department’s health informatics research team, where we developed award winning research, presented at the 2015 American Medical Informatics Association Annual Symposium & the 2015 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 15th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops. In returning to the university, I’ve devoted time to developing entry-level professionals by presenting my industry work-life experiences through UNC Charlotte’s graduate school’s Accelerate to Industry workforce development program. Internship(s): To expand my knowledge within the realms of data governance, I interned within the Dickson Advanced Analytics Group for Carolinas HealthCare System (now Atrium Health) during my master’s program. College Experience Why did you choose UNC Charlotte? I opted to attend UNC Charlotte because the program staff made me feel welcome and considered my experiences holistically. What made you choose data science? I was at a transitional point where I wanted to break away from the typecast of my career. I knew I had more to offer, and refused to be held down by those with limited vision. UNC Charlotte Highlights/Favorite Memory: My most favorite memory was seeing my face plastered across the campus bus stop, as part of the promotion & marketing campaign for the Health Informatics program. No one told me it was there, so it was such a surprise! Faculty/staff member who made an impact on you: I had (and have) a really good relationship with many of the faculty members in both my master’s and doctoral programs. And many of them have been impactful to me in different ways. Of the greatest impact,Joshua Hertel(from the health informatics program) was one of the most impactful because he presented me with a multitude of opportunities to get involved while within and after graduating from the program. For the doctoral in business administration program, Dr.Reginald Silveris a faculty member I connected with during my last semester of the Health Informatics program (at the time, he was a visiting instructor), who influenced & encouraged me to apply to the doctoral program. Advice for the next generation of Niners: Leverage campus activities and opportunities. And, if there’s an interest that doesn’t exist, then rally to create that space so you can grow. Also, know that it’s okay to follow your heart, and not the crowd (as long as it’s not harmful to others). What did you do after graduating from UNC Charlotte?: Upon graduating from UNC Charlotte, I entered the field of healthcare IT – which began with data analytics and then branched into opportunities in international process improvement, consulting, and marketing and communications. After about 5 years of that, I created a retail brand called SKATE SNOB (www.skatesnob.com). And, I’ve transitioned into analytical software sales & training. Is there any advice you would like to offer future female students wanting to get into the data science (STEM) field? Do it!! If you have a passion for it, you’ll find a way. Have you received an unfair judgment in a professional environment based on your gender? Yes, there have been a few times where this has occurred. It’s an unfortunate reality that sometimes stems from bigotry, antiquated mindsets, and/or groupthink. What’s surprising is that it can be projected from both men & women. On the flip side though, there have been more efforts towards women equality. And, I have met some advocates along the way (both male & female). Any additional information you would like to share? I’m a children’s book author. My first publication “Bailee Learns To Skate” is available on www.skatesnob.com. As well, I teach roller skating lessons in Charlotte, NC and have professionally taught actors and celebrities how to skate. I’ve been featured on CLEO TV’s “Boss Girls Guide” TV series and in “The Evolution of Skating Vol VI: This Is How We Roll”.',\n",

       "  'Q & A: Urban Education Master’s Program Alumni – Cato College of Education Skip to Main Content Q & A: Urban Education Master’s Program Alumni September 14, 2021 Categories:General News, UncategorizedTags:Default The inaugural class of graduates from UNC Charlotte’s novel online master’s program in urban education are applying their new skills in and outside of schools across the country. 24 students from diverse backgrounds earned their degree in May, introducing a group of teachers, entrepreneurs, administrators, and community leaders prepared to make a difference in significant, timely issues. The M.Ed. in Urban Education prepares professionals committed to delivering high-quality, culturally relevant instruction and services that meet the needs of students in increasingly diverse, urban school systems. The program provides practical tools and resources that increase the multicultural competence and awareness of graduates. Charlotte’s program is the only one of its kind nationally that devotes 100% of its courses to topics connected to critical issues in urban education. “We hope to equip our students with the appropriate means to combat disparities in education (close opportunity and discipline gaps), to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline, to address issues of race and racism in schools and communities, to fight for social justice, to honor diverse voices, to train urban youth to be critical thinkers, and to empower urban youth to become actively involved in their communities in ways that help to strengthen it,” said program director Bettie Butler. Several recent graduates shared their thoughts on their experiences with Charlotte’s M.Ed. in Urban Education. Sally S. Adnan Professional Background K-12 Education Why did you decide to apply for the program? Honestly, I did not know anything about this program until the day before the information session. That night, I was laying on my couch and browsing the web for advanced degrees in education. I knew that I wanted to pursue education as a profession, but I could not find my passion in any of the degrees in the field. Then something led me to the UNC Charlotte website, and as I was browsing I saw that there was an information session on Urban Education the very next day! It was a clear sign for me that this just may be where I find myself. When I attended the session the next day, every word from Dr. Butler made sense. I was inspired by the idea of challenging our education system’s underlying flaws researching the roots from where the education gap grows. What experiences were most valuable to you? Every course in the urban education program was very meaningful and rewarding. Learning about the various cultural backgrounds, systemic racism, various forms of discrimination, implicit bias, the influence of media and the school to prison pipeline are just a few examples of the profound content included in this degree. However, if I must pick one experience, I can say that my final project and research were perhaps the most rewarding experience. For me, it was definitely rewarding to see results in applying the theories and pedagogies I’ve been studying the past two years. The most valuable non-academic experience was meeting my class for the first time when we were about to graduate. Because of COVID-19, we were never able to meet, not even for presentations. As a result, graduation was a lot more exciting and special I’m sure for all of us. How do you think the training you received through the program will affect how you approach your career? Not only did the urban education program give me the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue competitive positions within the diversity and inclusion category of education, but it also gave me a calling for a social dilemma that needs trained and passionate personas to make a change. Some of the content and training in this program should be taught to all educators. I know this is a new program, but I’m sure that one day some of the material I learned in the past two years will become somewhat mandatory. It’s absolutely necessary if we want to eliminate educational disparities, and honestly, many other systemic inequities. Finally, for examples of the type of coursework completed in the M.Ed. Urban Education program, or if you would like to see my research podcast, please visit my page. Alexander Denham Professional Background I am currently a teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have worked as a teacher, coach, and educational consultant. Why did you decide to apply for the program? I decided to apply for the program because in the years leading up to my acceptance into the program, it became evident that I did not know things about the world around me. I grew up in a white, conservative, southern home, so my perspectives were only from that perspective. In my professional career, I began working in Title 1 schools, where for the first time in my life, I was the minority. This culture shock began to change my perspective. I was learning different perspectives that I never experienced. I realized quickly that the experiences of my students were completely different than my experiences growing up. It was time, personally and professionally, to learn about the histories of other cultures, how to best educate them in my profession, but also how to address other cultures in my everyday life. I began to question my beliefs, doubt what I was taught my entire life, and critically reflect on what I believe, who I am, and how I impact the world. What experiences were most valuable to you? The most valuable experience was completing the program with a great group of people. My cohort was a tight-knit community for an all-online program. The professors helped bring us all together virtually to create the best assignments and projects possible. The community built through this program will stay with me for years to come. How do you think the training you received through the program will affect how you approach your career? The training I received was invaluable. I learned more about myself during this program than the previous 10 plus years of my life. It will benefit my teaching, how I interact with students and teachers on an everyday basis, but more than that, it will change how I interact with the world around me. Jiadira Alexandra Choque Fernandez Professional Background I’m a middle school ELA teacher for Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools. Why did you decide to apply for the program? I love my job as a classroom teacher, but I felt like I was being called to something more. I was caught up between getting a Master’s in Reading Education, or maybe even Middle Grades Education, but when this program appeared it encompassed what I really cared about as an educator. This program had a lot of the issues that our education system is facing today such as analyzing the biases, inequalities, and systemic issues of our system. I spoke to Dr. Butler about wanting to become a professor at a university and she completely related to my first-generation-everything background. Being the first to go to college and graduate school was full of many unknowns, yet after meeting her and talking with her it made the decision much easier. After meeting her, hearing about the classes, and having a serious talk with myself I believe that this was the best decision I could have made. What experiences were most valuable to you? Within the program, there were so many wonderful professors that all helped build our knowledge and expertise in the field of urban education. And while the content was everything we ever needed I believe the best part about this program was how the professors practiced what they preached. When the pandemic started many of us were overwhelmed with the new balance and new scheduling we had to commit to. Yet, even dealing with their own struggles, our professors stepped in with helpful scheduling, virtual teaching advice, and an overwhelming amount of support and flexibility. The pandemic really did put into perspective everyone’s true nature and values and I believe everyone in this program provided so much help to us in a variety of ways. In addition, the research we conducted was also very valuable to me. This program was built so well that by the time we conducted our own research, we knew the theorists, we knew the practices, and we knew how to effectively begin and analyze our interventions and implementations. Looking back at our presentations, our class really did go above and beyond. The resilience to get our research completed was partly because of the history and truth that we were exposed to in class. How do you think the training you received through the program will affect how you approach your career? To think and question critically would have to be the most important thing when thinking about my career. Specifically, when looking at curriculum, our school culture, and even our own implicit biases, and working on them to ensure we are providing the best material, environment, and teachers for our scholars. It has pushed me to continue with my work as an educator and continue with my goal of becoming a professor for pre-service teachers.',\n",

http://cpm.charlotte.edu,Center for Precision Metrology,"Welcome to the Center for Precision Metrology The Center for Precision Metrology is an interdisciplinary association of faculty and student researchers at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, allied with industrial partners in the research, development and integration of precision metrology as applied to manufacturing. Working with dimensional tolerances on the order of 10 parts per million or better, precision metrology encompasses the methods of production and inspection in manufacturing, measurement, algorithms, tolerance representation, and the integration of metrology into factory quality systems. Our mission is to break new ground in precision metrology by addressing real-world industrial concerns. The Center received its initial federal support as a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (NSF I/UCRC) with two 5-year awards. The I/UCRC program is set up to allow industrial members and Center researchers to collaborate on projects that involve generic and specific manufacturing metrology problems. In support of these collaborative research efforts, the membership dues are applied to projects voted on by the members, supporting students through graduate research assistantships. This successful membership model has endured, although the Center has successfully graduated from the I/UCRC program in 2010. Additional specific research is funded through contracts with industrial partners to address proprietary application and development projects. The Center also engages in non-Affiliate research supported by the National Science Foundation, national laboratories, and other government agencies. Precision Metrology Exploration and applications of dimensional measurement to manufacturing and associated state-of-the-art processes with required dimensional tolerances on the order of ten parts per million; critical for remaining agile and competitive in a world economy where trends in all aspects of manufacturing are moving toward tighter tolerances. Interdisciplinary Synergy The Center for Precision Metrology synthesizes the practical needs for the industrial community with the interdisciplinary experience of faculty project leaders from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, chemistry, applied physics and business. These faculty have expertise encompassing machine metrology, precision controls, surface metrology applications and algorithms, computer-aided tolerancing and factory control, virtual and dynamic simulation, nanometric instrumentation, electro-optics and total quality management. Industrial Affiliate Membership Members of CPM’s Industrial Affiliates meet semi-annually to review progress of the projects within the program. Student researchers present their work and have the opportunity to discuss the technical details individually with industry leaders. In addition, new projects are proposed by faculty who collaborate with the industrial members to identify key projects that address generic and specific concerns in manufacturing metrology. Those projects which receive sufficient support of the members are initiated in the next year. Benefits of Affiliate membership include the frequent interaction with the Center’s faculty and students (many of whom end up working for affiliate members), access to the research projects as they are developed, and preferential access to the resources of the Center. Metrology and Associated Laboratories The Center maintains a host of state-of-the-art facilities in order to sustain research, development, and training in metrology. For critical measurement, many instruments are housed in a 1500 sq. ft. controlled environment, 20° ± 0.1° C, class 10,000 metrology laboratory. Other laboratories include computer-aided design, manufacturing, and modeling, precision motion systems, precision electro-optical systems, mechatronics, scanned probe microscopes, and instrument development, supported by a precision machine shop and an electronics shop.

https://fls.charlotte.edu,Faculty Legacy Scholarship,"Welcome to the Faculty Legacy Scholarship Site Vision To establish faculty-endowed scholarships that one day will enable all qualified students to attend UNC Charlotte with all of their financial need met. Brief History At the beginning of the spring semester of 2012, Michael Green, then President of the Faculty Council, presented an idea for initiating an endowment-based scholarship, funded principally by small payroll-deducted gifts given over a faculty member’s entire career. The arguments in favor of such a fund included: A college education is a transformative experience, perhaps the singular most important one in the lives of our youth. Hard economic times impact students and families disproportionately when tuition increases faster than inflation. Small gifts add up geometrically, and over many decades have the potential to become the largest endowed source of scholarships for UNC Charlotte. The FLS initiative allows participating faculty to leave UNC Charlotte a better place than when we arrived. Given these considerations and despite several years with no pay raise, the Faculty Council voted to establish an Ad Hoc committee to study the idea and make recommendations for its implementation. The Ad Hoc committee consisted of the President-elect of the Faculty Council, the individual college presidents, the four Bonnie Cone Distinguished Faculty, and three ex officio representatives from the Advancement Office, Financial Aid, and the Graduate School. Meeting weekly (an unprecedented schedule for university faculty), the Ad Hoc committee presented a set of recommendations to the Faculty Council at its March 22, 2012 meeting. The recommendations included (1) establishing the Faculty Legacy Scholarship, (2) adopting a statement of vision and principles, and (3) setting up a new standing committee of the Faculty Council – The Faculty Legacy Scholarship Committee. This committee will oversee the finances, procedures, and scholarship distribution of the FLS. Initially, the committee will award scholarships to students on the basis of both merit and financial hardship. Ultimately, the vision will be fulfilled when the FLS endowment is sufficiently large to meet the individual financial needs of all students admitted to UNC Charlotte. Early Years Scholarships The FLS is a hybrid, endowed fund. During its early years, 30% of gifts received one year will be awarded as FLS scholarships in the following year. The remaining 70% of gifts will be directed at growing the endowment. Eventually, the endowment will become sufficiently large so that it will generate increasing numbers of additional scholarships every year.

https://ibh.charlotte.edu,Integrated Behavioral Health Program,"Our Program Now Accepting Applications for AY24-25 IBH Scholars Cohort Apply Under the Participate Tab Now Accepting Applications for AY24-25 IBH Scholars Cohort Apply Under the Participate Tab Our Program Transformational changes are happening within healthcare in the United States. Healthcare systems are working to increase access, improve quality, and reduce cost. Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) models of care include evidence-based approaches that can reduce service barriers, improve patient mental and physical health, and provide greater cost-effectiveness in health care utilization (Woltmann et al., 2012; Katon et al., 2010; Melek et al., 2014). UNC Charlotte is training clinical social workers to meet these challenges. An estimated 46.6 million people in the U.S. experience mental health concerns each year; however, less than half (41%) actually receive behavioral health services (NAMI). 56 percent of those individuals treated are receiving services from a primary care provider rather than a trained behavioral health specialist (44%) (Kessler et al., 2005). IBH services bring specialized services to patients seeking care in settings that are familiar and destigmatizing. IBH is an interprofessional care approach where medical and behavioral health professionals work together to address patients’ overall health. IBH is holistic, patient-centered, team-based, and systems-oriented . The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recently invested over $146 million for integrated behavioral health workforce development. Beginning in 2017, the UNC Charlotte School of Social Work originally received a four-year $1.8 million award to offer student stipends, interprofessional curriculum, enhanced training, and community education in 2017. The UNC Charlotte School of Social Work IBH Team working collaboratively with our community partners submitted a successful HRSA BHWET Grant Application and received continuation funding for four additional years. UNC Charlotte was notified over the summer that the application was successful and that we received renewal funding for our Integrated Behavioral Health Program. The focus of the HRSA BHWET Grant for the next four years is on high need children, adolescents, and transitional aged youth. SSW IBH Program Infographic What does the UNC Charlotte IBH Program do? The UNC Charlotte IBH Program is proud to be educating the future integrated behavioral health workforce and improving behavioral health care access regionally. Our program has four primary goals: 1. Develop MSW training and curricula that addresses IBH needs and reflects emerging innovation and evidence-based practice (EBP) models; 2. Create robust, well-supported IBH field placements within health care settings; 3. Establish highly desired placement opportunities for health care organizations and MSW students; and 4.

https://trans.charlotte.edu,Trans Resources,"Welcome to UNC Charlotte's Trans. This initiative is a campus-wide partnership operated out of the Office of Identity, Equity, and Engagement . UNC Charlotte utilizes the term 'trans' as an umbrella and inclusive term for those that transgress or transition between gender norms. This could include, but is not limited to, those who identify as transgender, transexual, transvestite, individuals with an intersex condition, genderqueer or non-binary individuals. These individuals often transcend and transgress gender norms. They often find it difficult to navigate systems that are set up with only two separate gender options (male/female). Some trans people seek medical and/or legal means to change their assigned birth sex or gender and some may simply identify or present themselves differently than their assigned birth sex or gender. The purpose of this website is to provide basic information, policies and support resources for trans students on UNC Charlotte's campus. Information — Discusses basic information on trans identities and national organizations for trans individuals. Policies — Outlines UNC Charlotte departmental policies and procedures that may affect trans students, as well as information on North Carolina and Federal guidelines for changing your name and/or gender marker. Support — Houses information on support for trans students both on and off campus and resources for those looking to transition. Restrooms — Designates all buildings on campus and discusses what restrooms are available in each building. Sometimes finding a comfortable place to use the facilities can be difficult for people who do not identify as male or female or may be in the process of transitioning. Contact — For questions regarding the Trans Committee at UNC Charlotte please contact Dr. Erica Lennon . As of October 2017, the Campaign for Southern Equality has just published its Trans resource list for the South. In this new version of Trans in the South , you’ll find lists of trans-friendly service providers – from doctors to attorneys to counselors – across the South as well as resources to assist with funding medical transition. Over the past year we’ve worked hard to add more resources to each state in the guide. And we’ve significantly expanded resources related to HIV/AIDS services and added resources that offer support services for trans folks. In recognition and appreciation of grassroots work led by trans folks across the South, this update also includes links to local resource guides.",0

The U.S Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office (SETO) has awarded $4.6 million to Professor Sukumar Kamalasadan ( The University of North Carolina at Charlotte) for the project “Optimal Reconfiguration and Resilient Control Framework for Real-Time Photovoltaic Dispatch to Manage Critical Infrastructure (ReDis-PV)”. The project will develop a grid management tool that detects cyber and physical threats, and forms dynamic clusters to optimally manage photovoltaic and energy . The project coll a borating team includes U niversity of North Carolina at Charlotte, Clemson University, New Mexico State university, Florida International University, Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, OPAL-RT Corporation and Duke Energy . Lead Organization: The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Principal Investigator: Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan More about the project can be found here : https://www.redispv.org/ UNC Charlotte Smart Grid Lab Getting Smarter Created to educate the next generation of electrical power distribution engineers and to advance research into integrating renewable power into the grid, UNC Charlotte’s Duke Energy Smart Grid Laboratory has been fulfilling its mission since 2012. Partnering with utilities, universities and governmental agencies, the momentum of laboratory researchers has been increasing in the past two years with a number of new projects, including two major research grants from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) totaling more than $8 million. Throughout the life of the Smart Grid Lab, Duke Energy has provided financial support and research expertise to advance the study of power distribution and forecasting. Students from UNC Charlotte’s W.S. Lee College of Engineering who were trained in the lab have now gone on to work for Duke Energy, and are part of ongoing research collaborations between the utility and the university. The Smart Grid Lab is part of UNC Charlotte’s Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC) . “The Smart Grid Lab is a resource that allows us to build research expertise, and educate undergraduate and graduate students who are now leaders in our partnering companies, ” said Dr. Mike Mazzola, Executive Director of EPIC. “Since 2018, the lab has been advancing much of its previous research to full demonstration modes, which has been the purpose of the lab from the very start. The Smart Grid Lab is at the heart of two major grants we have won in the past two years.” In 2020, SETO awarded $4.6 million to UNC Charlotte Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan for the project “Optimal Reconfiguration and Resilient Control Framework for Real-Time Photovoltaic Dispatch to Manage Critical Infrastructure.” The purpose of the project is to advance solar energy’s role in strengthening the resilience of the U.S. electricity grid. The project is developing a grid management tool that detects cyber and physical threats, and forms dynamic clusters to optimally manage photovoltaics and energy storage. In 2021, SETO awarded a $3.6 million grant to improve the resilience and reliability of the regional electrical grid. Dr. Badrul Chowdhury, who holds a joint position as professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Systems Engineering and Engineering Management Department, is the principal investigator. The project, one of 10 chosen nationwide and the only one in North Carolina, is part of a collaborative effort among state government, utility companies, industry and universities to develop an advanced microgrid control architecture. The research will seamlessly coordinate microgrids with the bulk power grid at multiple points, automatically balancing load and generation while safely providing critical services. The proposed control architecture will be tested using a unique digital-twin approach, which will have direct, real-time connections between laboratories and microgrids. A field demonstration at Duke Energy’s Hot Springs microgrid is planned. Other ongoing projects in the Smart Grid Lab include: Distributed Energy Storage and EV Holding Capacity with Value Proposition Development = $90,000 Comparative Power Flow Analysis and Power Flow Quality Criteria – Phase I = $45,000 Comparative Power Flow Analysis and Power Flow Quality Criteria – Phase II = $45,000 Identification, and Mitigation of Coordinated Attacks on Distributed Energy Management = $90,000 Developing a Combined System Model and Simulation Process for Integrated Planning and Operations across Transmission and Distribution Systems = $200,000 Planning an Affordable, Resilient, and Sustainable Grid in North Carolina = $201,000 Duke Energy Smart Grid Laboratory Computers have come to the electric grid, and the Duke Energy Smart Grid laboratory at The William States Lee College of Engineering is educating the engineers who will be running this improved grid and performing research to achieve top efficiency in the new digital world. The modernizing of the grid with digital devices is known as Smart Grid technology. This new technology is so important to improving grid efficiency that Duke Energy donated $1.8 million to help establish the Smart Grid Lab within the new Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC) building on the UNC Charlotte campus. Additional funding from the State of North Carolina for building space, equipment and infrastructure totals $1 million. “Grid modernization is a cornerstone of the type of research we are doing in EPIC,” said Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan, director of the Smart Grid Lab. “As such, we have been given a very beautiful corner location in the EPIC building to build our lab. It is a key spot in the building for demonstrating our research and educational programs.” The lab is important to both undergraduate and graduate education. “We are teaching the next generation engineers to join the power industry,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “This lab provides the learning environment to educate students to work in the smart grid world. We are also giving them the skills to be able to engineer and design the next-generation power grid.” At the heart of the lab’s extensive equipment are the Real Time Digital Simulators (RTDS). “RTDS lets us work in real time,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “We can pull in digital information about generation and transmission from multiple sources all at the same time and see how the system react during changing conditions. We can then experiment methodologies to make the power grid more efficient without putting the real grid at risk.” Advanced research and educational activities is being done in the Smart Grid lab by the EPIC Power Grid Modernization Cluster. This interdisciplinary group is composed of several faculty members and their associated graduate and undergraduate students. Grid modernizing research deals with digitized equipment, micro-processors and micro-computers based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED) being added to grid infrastructure to make it more reliable and efficient. Researchers collect and analyze data on how these digital systems, along with renewable energy, peaking power, redistributed loads and other components impact the grid. “We have a huge amount of resource space that allows us to collect and analyze all of the data being sent to us by multiple utilities,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “With RTDS we can determine how changing grid variables impact overall systems, and we can then suggest strategic grid level improvements. Most importantly, the lab will also serve as a vehicle for education and training related to grid modernization and thus help build next generation power grid workforce” In the near future the Smart Grid Lab will be integrated with additional power systems laboratories on the ground floor of EPIC. This connection with the five labs of the Duke Energy Power Suite will allow for even greater research, education and analysis of power generation capabilities and variables. For more information on the Smart Grid Lab contact Dr. Kamalasadan . College of Engineering Advancing the Future of Solar Energy At The William States Lee College of Engineering, our students, faculty and alumni are engaged in a multitude of activities that are advancing solar energy. In classrooms, our students are studying the principles of photovoltaics and tackling hands-on learning projects that teach them to work with solar energy. In laboratories, our researchers are designing improved solar cells, developing technologies for delivering solar power to the grid, and advancing methods for storing and using solar power at maximum efficiency. In the commercial world, our entrepreneurs are creating jobs as they take solar energy to the next level. As a state university, UNC Charlotte’s mission is to deliver higher education, improve the lives of citizens and support North Carolina industry. This mission makes the Lee College of Engineering’s solar power work extremely important, because North Carolina is the second largest solar power producing state in the country . “In North Carolina we have the second most capacity to connect solar power to the grid of any state in the country, behind only California,” said Dr. Mike Mazzola, executive director of UNC Charlotte’s Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (EPIC). “And we are actually number one in utility-scale solar power, because a lot of California’s generation is from residential roof-top solar panels.” Solar power production in North Carolina is expected to grow even faster in the next decade, thanks in part to NC House Bill 589. The measure, a collaboration between utility officials and solar interests, establishes a competitive bidding program and a solar power leasing program. “By allowing third-party solar producers to sell power to the grid, residential solar production will definitely be growing in North Carolina in the next few years,” Dr. Mazzola said. “South Carolina and Georgia are also adding a lot of solar capacity, making this region an even greater solar producer.” This growing solar industry will require a larger workforce to design, build, operate and maintain it, and solar engineers will be in greater demand. To prepare these future engineers, the Lee College of Engineering has numerous solar-related educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Solar Engineering Education “The founding mission of EPIC is workforce development,” Dr. Mazzola said. “Through college of engineering programs, we give students a taste of renewable energy, including solar, as part of their education. These efforts help inspire students who are excited and motivated about the future of renewable energy.” The college of engineering offers energy concentrations in all six of its undergraduate degree programs. The concentrations require students to take a group of technical electives focused on energy, which can include renewables, solar and grid integration of these technologies. Solar energy studies may also be part of required core courses. One example is Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) students designing and fabricating solar cells in the Cameron Center clean room, as part of their lab work in Sophomore Design ECGR 2252 . In their year-long senior design projects, student teams have completed a number of solar-related projects in the past few years. Many of these projects are sponsored by solar power companies in the Carolinas. Examples of such senior design projects include: Design of a solar array micro-grid system for a 500kW solar facility in connection with SCE&G. Development of a simulation tool for Duke Energy to assess the benefits of battery energy storage on a power distribution system with large solar generation. Design of a rooftop photovoltaic array for a campus parking deck for UNC Charlotte Facilities. Development and field testing solar power companion inverters for Rivegy. A study to identify the potential uses of solar thermal energy at a regional utility plant on campus for UNC Charlotte Facilities. In a project for the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) addressing the vegetation maintenance issues associated with large solar farms, students have developed autonomous lawn mowers that use solar recharging stations . At the graduate level, Lee College of Engineering students also take renewable-energy-related courses, such as ECGR 4290 Science and Engineering of Photovoltaic. Many students also serve as research assistants, working with their faculty mentors on solar-related research. “At all levels,” Dr. Mazzola said, “there is an educational environment and culture surrounding our students here that deals with the very-real issues involved in renewable energy, a major part of which is solar.” Solar Engineering Research In the area of research, the college of engineering impacts solar energy from the fundamentals of producing better materials for solar cells, to the incredibly complex issues of how to use and store photovoltaic generated power for the grid. “With our state-of-the-art EPIC facilities, we are able to carry out solar research on a number of levels,” Dr. Mazzola said. “In our Photovoltaic Technology Research, Photovoltaic Integration, Renewable Power, Smart Grid, Flexible Energy and other laboratories, we have the capability to study, develop and test solar energy research. These capabilities are important to our researchers, and make us an attractive full-service applied research partner for working on grants with business and industry.” Some of the solar research now underway in EPIC laboratories includes: In the Photovoltaic Technology Research Laboratory, led by Dr. Aba Ebong, ECE, researchers are designing, manufacturing and testing new ways to make solar cells. The research is leading to improved efficiency in solar cells, while at the same time developing manufacturing techniques to make them more cheaply. Improvement methods include increasing the number of busbars to five from the standard three, using grid line segmentation to reduce metal shading to less than five percent, and using bifacial solar structures. Dr. Yong Zhang ’s, ECE, research involves growing new semiconductor materials for power electronics, including solar power applications. Using molecular beam epitaxy methods, he and his students build materials a layer at a time, with each layer being as thin as one atom. The Photovoltaic Integration Lab is developing inverters for the crucial power interface between photovoltaic solar panels and the grid. Under the direction of Dr. Babak Parkhideh, ECE, the lab is using advanced power electronics to make inverters smaller and more flexible, with better efficiencies for PV integration Led by Dr. Madhav Manjrekar, the Renewable Power Laboratory consists of solar array simulators from Ametek, which can mimic power profiles generated either by a single solar panel or a large solar array. Capable of supplying from 35Vdc up to 1000Vdc, these simulators can be employed to test the latest panel-level micro-inverters or central solar inverters that support dc link voltages upwards of 800Vdc. A solar power research area of growing importance is the prediction, storage and use of solar generated power. A number of UNC Charlotte faculty are working on this issue. “The question is, when are people going to turn on the lights? When is the power going to be used? There has always been a degree of uncertainty knowing this,” Dr. Mazzola said. “With 10 percent of generation during the day now being solar, which has its own degrees of uncertainty, the questions of supply and demand become even more complex. And in the near future, when even more people have their own residential solar power to use and to sell to the grid, this will become even more complicated.” Researchers working on these questions include: Dr. Tao Hong and his Systems Engineering students are experts in the area of energy forecasting and optimization. Their work applies various statistical and optimization techniques to the development of algorithms and tools for energy forecasting, power system planning, renewable integration, reliability planning and risk management. Working with a Duke Energy photovoltaic and battery storage system testbed , Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan, ECE, and his students are compiling data and creating algorithms to increase the efficiency of how solar power is used on the grid. The work includes solutions for when to use the energy directly, when to store it in batteries, and when to use the battery power. Working to various degree in the areas of advanced renewable energy systems modeling and analytical systems, integration of renewable energy resources, renewable forecasting, grid market integration and building control systems, are Dr. Valentina Cecchi, ECE, Dr. Umit Cali, Engineering Technology and Construction Management (ETCM), Dr. Weimin Wan, ETCM, and Dr. Badrul Chowdhury, ECE and Systems Engineering. Solar Engineering Entrepreneurship Taking UNC Charlotte’s applied solar technology research to the next level, a number of startup companies have been formed to commercialize photovoltaic power solutions. “We’ve become a leader in entrepreneurship,” Dr. Mazzola said. “Beyond working on the fundamental problems of the technology, our researchers are also heling to spin off a number of companies. This application of research directly impacts North Carolina’s future by creating jobs and strengthening our economy.” Rivegy is a National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant funded company that was spun off from UNC Charlotte research. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is also collaborating with the company on power electronics architecture. Rivegy is developing power electronics for use in solar and other distributed energy applications. Its proprietary Rivegy SDSI (Software-defined Synthetic Inverter) enables low-cost, long-life, high-efficiency, and flexibility to usher in the next generation of smart distributed energy systems. Founded in 2011, the startup company Sinewatts works closely with researchers in the EPIC Photovoltaic Integration Lab. The company has won two rounds of funding from the Department of Energy’s SunShot Program. Its products are microchip inverters that convert the energy coming from solar panels from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Solar Engineering Future For the future, advance solar technologies will continue to be developed and refined. As legislation makes solar a more viable technology for home owners, the complexity of managing solar power will become even greater. “Solar power engineers will be needed in all these new areas to solve future problems,” Dr. Mazzola said. “We are educating and preparing these engineers. We are continuing to integrate more solar, and other renewable energy studies, into our curricula.” The social sciences, and even political science, will also play a bigger role in the future management of solar power, as consumer mindsets about energy use begin to change. “Right now, the amount of power we generate follows the amount of energy load that is needed,” Dr. Mazzola said. “We’re starting to see indications that there could be a complete reversal of this in the future, which means load demand will follow generation capability instead of visa versa. It’s going to be an interesting time. The research in our laboratories and the technologies developed by our spinoff companies is going to be extremely important in the creation of and management of solar power. At UNC Charlotte, we’re looking forward to it. We’re here and we’re ready.” Battery Energy Storage System Management for Improving Power Grid Reliability To improve the way solar power is integrated and distributed to the grid using grid level batteries, Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Professor Dr. Sukumar Kamalasadan and his students have been performing research at Duke Energy’s photovoltaic and battery storage system testbed in Catawba County since 2013. The research has developed and quantified a number of cost-saving measures, and soon the value-management system will be integrated in the field for managing the solar power farm. The Power Grid Connected Energy Storage Management project initially began as a battery storage system study for use with photovoltaics as part of grid modernization. The purpose was to solve the inconsistency problems of photovoltaics caused by weather changes. The researchers worked to balance solar power capacity by using batteries that are charged at times of excess solar output and then discharged when the power is needed on the grid. “We decided to start at the Sherrills Ford distribution feeder, which has an existing PV farm with 1 MW installed capacity,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “Nearby is a 250 KW/750Kwh battery storage facility. Our EPIC (Energy Production and Infrastructure Center) researchers had expertise in renewables, and we formed a team to develop an algorithm to smooth the output from solar energy. We concentrated on keeping voltage levels consistent when the PV output changes due to weather and simultaneously used the battery power to feed the feeder load during peak-load times.” The first step in the research was to gather field data to be used in building the feeder model and control algorithm. Based on the data, the team developed a control strategy for more evenly distributing the photovoltaic output. “First, in 2013-14, we developed a system to transfer the data through the internet to the Smart Grid lab at UNC Charlotte. After the communication link was successfully established we designed the initial testbed and evaluated the proof-of-concept,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “We then deployed the algorithm on a hardware controller to connect to the battery in the field. The results showed a much more efficient control performance than sending a signal from the UNCC campus.” Then the team developed a stacked algorithm to optimize battery charge and simultaneously supply battery power with three goals in mind, to smooth the PV farm output, regulate the voltage, and feed the feeder load at the peak power usage time. In 2015, they integrated historical weather patterns into the algorithm to optimize the amount of charge the batteries had at the start of the day, so that they would have the power needed for distribution on cloudy days or the capacity needed for storage on sunny days. “This was very challenging,” Dr. Kamalasadan said. “There are always more variables to control in real life than what you plan for in the lab.” In 2016, the team looked at the actual dollar value of using battery storage with the stacked algorithm to smooth PV output, and at regulating the voltage and sending power from the battery during peak load. Five main power quality and energy management areas for monetary savings were identified and savings were calculated. The team also looked at how well the controllers performed in maintaining the voltage interacting with other controllers in the field. The next step in the project will be to develop a fully integrated value management system for use in the distribution system that will both manage the photovoltaics and calculate the overall commercial value. “Overall Duke Energy has benefitted in optimizing the efficiency of the feeder when the PV farms are integrated,” Dr. Kamalasadan said, “and UNC Charlotte has benefitted in being able to provide this wonderful learning experience to our students. What I like about this project more than anything else is that we converted the algorithm into a value-based approach that could quantify the actual savings. We demonstrated a strong business case model that shows how the algorithm can be deployed in the field based on monetary value.”",0

Advocacy & Support Education Get Involved About Us IEE's Break Survival Guide Boundaries A boundary is simply a “dividing line” “In psychological terms, it’s a catch-phrase meaning setting limits or asserting your thoughts, feelings, and needs even when these are in opposition to the person with whom you’re interacting. Communicate with yourself, your partner, friends, and/or family about what you want/need. Get on the same page regarding what you all need to reduce miscommunication. Know Yourself Spend time reflecting on what you want to get out of your break. What is going to bring you joy? Make a list of people or things that you want to spend time with. Identify the item you want to say “yes” and “no” to. Find your core values, and follow those values every day to uplift you! Self Care If you know that you are going to be around certain emotionally taxing people, do not forget to put yourself first and either opt out or limit the amount of time you spend with individuals. Your feelings matter! Prioritizing taking care of yourself, this will allow you to show up for others the way you want to this season. Pick up your old hobby that you didn’t have much time to do during the busy semester or find a new hobby during this mini-break. Rest and Rejuvenate It is even more critical during a season of high demands to take care of yourself to reduce exhaustion, stress, and emotional vulnerability. Don’t forget to slow down and take a good deep breath. If you’re too busy getting caught up with everything, you may miss the things you tend to enjoy. Learn to Say 'No' Knowing your limits and saying “no” is part of self-care. If someone takes 'no' personally, it isn’t you; it’s them. Set your boundaries, put yourself first, and listen to what you need. University Resources Below are some of our university resources available for students.

https://ombuds.charlotte.edu,University Ombuds,"Welcome The University Ombuds program at UNC Charlotte is a confidential, independent, impartial, and informal resource for faculty, staff, and graduate students to informally work through challenging workplace problems, dilemmas and conflicts. The office adheres to the International Ombuds Association Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice . The University Ombuds uses a number of interest-based techniques, such as coaching, facilitated discussions, and shuttle diplomacy, to help prevent problems from escalating and empower faculty, staff, and graduate students find productive, collaborative solutions to their own problems when appropriate. Ombuds often help by providing an unbiased, non-judgmental listening ear to understand the situation, clarifying issues, by being a thought partner in exploring a full range of possible options, thinking through the pros and cons of the various choices, and helping visitors come to a decision on how they’d like to proceed. We also provide feedback on emerging or systemic concerns and recommendations for positive change to University policies and practices when appropriate. Communications with the Ombuds Office are confidential. The only exceptions are when we believe that disclosure is necessary to address imminent risk of serious harm or if required by law. The Ombuds is not part of any formal administrative complaint procedure, and communicating with the Ombuds does not put UNC Charlotte on formal notice of a problem.

https://cs4all.charlotte.edu,Broadening Participation in CS4All in NC,"CS4All What We seek to enhance the teaching of Computer Science content using online resources with a long term goal to increase participation in high school courses by students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The goal of the partnership is to leverage the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course offered online by NCVirtual throughout NC. In the proposed work, we plan to address one of the structural constraints (e.g., not enough teachers) faced when broadening participation through the use of automated assessment tools. Furthermore, to make computing relevant to a diverse student population, we plan to create culturally responsive teaching materials and train teachers on their use. We will accomplish these goals by creating an RPP in NC. Who This project seeks to create a ​Research-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) with the NCVirtual , researchers at UNC Charlotte, and school districts near Charlotte. Why As our world continues to become more technology driven, the need for computer scientists continues to surge. Unfortunately, technology growth and the demand for computer scientists is outpacing how fast we can overcome our structural constraints to satisfy that demand. Furthermore, the existing inequities in society are limiting participation in computing to a select few groups. High schools struggle to not only get more teachers trained to offer CS courses, but also to diversify the students taking computing courses. All forecasts indicate that this demand for CS professionals will continue to grow. Based on the US Department of Labor statistics, Computer and Information technology jobs are predicted to increase 12% from 2018 to 2028. But the diversification of the workforce is not keeping pace with the growth. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2031496.

https://redlair.charlotte.edu,Redlair Observatory,"The Redlair Observatory The Redlair Observatory is a multidisciplinary initiative for long-term environmental, ecological, and hydrological monitoring at the Spencer Mountain C onservation Area . The land on which the Observatory operates is a collective of several privately and publicly owned, preserved and conserved land parcels adjacent to the South Fork of the Catawba River in Gaston County, North Carolina ( Map ). The largest parcel of the conserved area is the Redlair Preserve , owned by the North Carolina Plant Conservation Program (PCP). View this story-map for an overview of Redlair from the PCP. View this video related to ongoing research related rock cracking being conducted at Redlair by Dr. Martha Cary (Missy) Eppes. Redlair Observatory activities are maintained and managed through a partnership of Universities, the State of North Carolina , and other non-profit organizations. The mission of the Redlair Observatory is to provide a much-needed, long-term, high-resolution database of groundwater, surface water, soils, ecology and weather that spans the South Fork floodplain up to small (95% of the watersheds of local streams and rivers. These small watersheds are major contributors to water quality in large rivers of the Piedmont, and the Observatory is located on the uban fringe of the largest metropolitan area in this region of the Carolinas. Observatory data will be available for researchers, planners, land managers and K-16 educators – providing long-term insight into undeveloped watersheds adjacent to the rapidly growing urban areas of Charlotte and Gastonia. The Observatory is broadly similar in its long-term mission in both research and education to federally funded Critical Zone Observatories and Long-Term Ecological Research Sites. Combined with its proximity to the rapidly growing Charlotte metropolitan area, the Observatory has strong potential to achieve distinction as a key location for natural data in the Piedmont of the southeastern United States.

https://reading.charlotte.edu,Reading Education Programs,"Homepage Reading Education Programs at UNC Charlotte Reading and literacy are fundamental to learning across all subjects and levels in school. Beyond the classroom, literacy skills are vital for success in the workplace, civic participation and navigating most facets of our lives. The reading education programs in the Cato College of Education seek to prepare educators to help students at all levels to support reading and literacy in and out of schools. While students in all licensure programs in the Cato College of Education receive instruction in reading and literacy, we offer several programs from undergraduate to graduate that build depth of knowledge and skill in teaching for literacy educators. Here is a snapshot of these programs with links to more in-depth information about each: the Minor in Reading Education & Early Entry for undergraduates to the M.Ed. in Reading Education program the Advanced Literacy in Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate the M.Ed. in Reading Education the Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction with a concentration in Literacy Minor in Reading Education & Early Entry to the M.Ed. in Reading program The Minor in Reading Education is an 18-credit-hour program for undergraduate teacher education students. This program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. Early entry provides undergraduates with the opportunity to complete up to a third of the M.Ed. in Reading while working on their undergraduate teacher education program. Additionally, Elementary Education majors completing the Reading Education Minor can count up to 9 hours of graduate courses toward BOTH the M.Ed. in Reading and the Reading Minor. Either way, early entry is a great way to complete part of your master’s in reading as an undergraduate teacher education student. One added benefit is that some graduate reading courses are offered during the summer. Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate The ALII Certificate is a fully online 12-hour graduate certificate program designed to provide teachers and other educational professionals with tools to meet the literacy and learning needs of K-12 students. Apply to start the program any term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Master’s in Reading Education Learn more about our Graduate Reading Programs. The M.Ed. in Reading Education is a 33 credit-hour fully online program designed for classroom teachers, aspiring literacy and reading specialists and others whose work involves literacy education who are interested in improving instructional programs and practices that promote literacy among all learners. Apply to start the program any term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction with a Concentration in Reading The Literacy Education strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Reading Education, English Education, Teaching English as a Second Language, and Foreign Language Teacher Education encompassing dimensions of language, culture, and literacies broadly defined as they relate to urban education. Have questions about our programs? Email us at reading-programs@charlotte.edu Check out our News features for current updates and information Frequently Asked Questions Admissions requirements and deadlines for M.Ed. in ALII? Students applying for admission to the Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention AND the M.Ed. in Reading Education programs must have: A bachelor’s degree, or its equivalent, from a regionally accredited college or university Students who hold a bachelor’s degree are expected to have a GPA of at least 3.00 (based on a 4.0 scale) on all previous work completed beyond high school (secondary school). Students applying for early entry are expected to have a 3.2 GPA or higher. An online application through the Graduate School’s application system for the M.Ed. in Reading. A statement of purpose Transcripts of all college coursework attempted Official and satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), if English is not the applicant’s native language and he or she has not earned a post-secondary degree from a U.S. institution Standardized test scores are NOT required for admission (e.g., GRE, GMAT, MAT). Test scores may be submitted as an option by applicants to provide additional information or supplement their application. Students applying for admission to the M.Ed. in Reading Education are required to have all the of above PLUS: Three professional recommendations (submit names and emails, the Graduate School sends out a form, no letter writing required). This is not required for the ALII Certificate. Application Deadlines Students can start the program any full term: Spring, Summer or Fall. Applications for Spring are due by Dec. 1 while Summer start applications are due by April 30 and applications for Fall start are due by Aug. 1 of that year. Are programs online or in person? Our undergraduate programs like the Minor in Reading Education are in-person and the majority of courses are face-to-face. The M.Ed. in Reading and the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate are both fully online. Courses are delivered in the Canvas learning management system with some instructors also using video meetings through platforms like Zoom. Early Entry students take master’s level courses which are online. Coursework for the Ph.d. program varies with a mix of face-to-face and online. What about Scholarships & Grants? We encourage students to apply for scholarships and grants through the Niner Scholarship Portal . There are two grants we encourage applicants and students to check out. The TEACH Grant i s a federal grant designed to encourage highly qualified teachers to serve in low-income schools in high-need fields. It requires a service agreement with the potential to convert grant monies paid to a student loan. The federal Department of Education has a website with information about TEACH grants. Established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, the Forgivable Education Loans for Service provides financial assistance to qualified students enrolled in an approved education program and committed to working in critical employment shortage professions in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority provides administration for the program. For the 2022-2023 academic year the approved degree programs and approved institutions can be found via the Scholarship Resource Section. What about teaching certifications? Successful completion of the minor, along with a passing score on the Praxis 5206 exam, will lead to a recommendation for a North Carolina add-on K-12 license in Reading. The M.Ed. in Reading Education program qualifies graduates who hold a North Carolina professional educator’s license for an Advanced North Carolina K-12 Reading Education license at the master’s level. Graduates from the program with initial teaching license may apply for an Initial Professional License (IPL) at the M-level and will need to pass the associated licensure assessment (Praxis 5302) within 3 years to convert it to a Continuing Professional License (CPL) at the Master’s Level (M-level). Graduates from the program who do not have a professional educator’s license can earn the M.Ed. in Reading degree but will not be eligible for licensure at any level. The Advanced Literacy Instruction and Intervention Certificate does not lead to any teaching certifications nor does the Ph.D. programs in Curriculum & Instruction. What are career options for graduates? The Minor in Reading Education program is designed for students already seeking initial licensure in another content area who wish to gain expertise in reading methods in the K-12 public school setting. The minor provides additional expertise in reading and literacy adding to the employablity of our graduates. Many of the graduates with the M.Ed. in Reading Education who are already teaching move into teacher leader roles such as grade-level lead teachers or subject area chairperson while others become Reading Specialists or Literacy Coaches who work with teachers to improve literacy instruction through coaching, modeling, co-teaching and leading professional development. Some literacy specialists work with students in pull-out groups to support their literacy advancement. We now accept students who are not classroom teachers and do not have an initial teaching license and for those outside of the school setting there is a range of possibilities including tutoring and working with non-profits that serve children through out-of-school programs during the summer or after-school. Graduates with from the Reading Strand of the Curriculum and Instruction Ph.D. program have a variety of career paths with many successfully entering academia in tenure-track positions while others move into leadership positions in school districts. What are graduates saying about the programs? Here’s what graduates have said about the Graduate Reading programs and its impact on their work as educators: The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. I have been able to grow in my confidence as a literacy leader and feel better equipped to support and lead my colleagues. –2021 graduate Looking at data and making data-based decisions as guided by the assignments of this program helped me target students’ needs in my current classroom. The way this program was designed helped me see my path as an educator going forward. –2021 graduate The program has better equipped me as a current literacy teacher and a future literacy leader. It has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my own teaching practices and also practice first-hand new literacy research and strategies through case studies and projects. –2021 graduate This program allowed me to explore so many aspects of literacy from K-12 and has allowed me to offer more differentiation to my students and make my classroom a more equitable learning environment for every individual in my classroom. –2019 Graduate I live and work in a rural school in Southeastern Illinois. Many of my students are significantly behind in reading and writing…and through the online Reading M.Ed. program at UNC Charlotte I gained knowledge in diagnostic assessments and evidence-based approaches to develop differentiated and targeted approaches to reading instruction that would reach my students where they are. –2019 Graduate During my experience at UNC Charlotte, I developed close relationships with the faculty and classmates. To this day, I continue to seek input and advice from classmates in the M.Ed program when faced with professional challenges. The knowledge and skills I obtained from the program opened many doors for me professionally. — 2015 Graduate What are the degree and work requirements for M.Ed. & ALII Certificate? Applicants to the M.Ed. and ALII Certificate programs must have a bachelor’s degree from a regionally-accredited university. Candidates are not required to have teaching experience, although teaching or work with K-12 students in literacy in our out of schools is highly recommended. What are the estimated program costs? Programs costs depend on your residency status which is determined the State of North Carolina. Below is an estimate of costs for our M.Ed. in Reading Education and our Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Certificate programs as of Feb. 2022: ALII Certificate Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $3,364.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident: $521.29 per credit hour $6,256.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Advanced Literacy Instruction & Intervention Graduate Certificate Master’s of Reading Education Resident: $280.34 per credit hour $9,252.00 est. program cost Outside of NC Non-Resident : $521.29 per credit hour $17,203.00 est. program cost **For most up-to-date estimate of costs please visit the School of Professional Studies program website for the Reading Education, M.Ed.

M.Ed. in Reading Education Course Sequence The master’s program is a two-year program for most students taking two courses per Fall and Spring term and three courses taking in two summer terms. The current course of study for students depends on what semester they start. See our Fall-Spring-Summer start sequence document for the classes students typically take depending on when they begin the program. We strongly encourage students starting the program to begin their first summer taking one or two courses. This lightens the courseload during the second Summer from 9 hours to 6 or 3 hours.

https://identity.charlotte.edu,"Office of Identity, Equity, and Engagement","Welcome to the Office of Identity, Equity, and Engagement! We educate, develop, and engage students regarding their various intersecting identities (gender identity, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identity, etc). The mission of the Office of Identity, Equity and Engagement is to support students who hold historically minoritized identities in an effort to enhance a university culture that embraces inclusive excellence. Advocacy & Support Education Get Involved About Us IEE's Break Survival Guide Boundaries A boundary is simply a “dividing line” “In psychological terms, it’s a catch-phrase meaning setting limits or asserting your thoughts, feelings, and needs even when these are in opposition to the person with whom you’re interacting. Communicate with yourself, your partner, friends, and/or family about what you want/need. Get on the same page regarding what you all need to reduce miscommunication. Know Yourself Spend time reflecting on what you want to get out of your break. What is going to bring you joy? Make a list of people or things that you want to spend time with. Identify the item you want to say “yes” and “no” to. Find your core values, and follow those values every day to uplift you! Self Care If you know that you are going to be around certain emotionally taxing people, do not forget to put yourself first and either opt out or limit the amount of time you spend with individuals. Your feelings matter! Prioritizing taking care of yourself, this will allow you to show up for others the way you want to this season. Pick up your old hobby that you didn’t have much time to do during the busy semester or find a new hobby during this mini-break. Rest and Rejuvenate It is even more critical during a season of high demands to take care of yourself to reduce exhaustion, stress, and emotional vulnerability. Don’t forget to slow down and take a good deep breath. If you’re too busy getting caught up with everything, you may miss the things you tend to enjoy. Learn to Say 'No' Knowing your limits and saying “no” is part of self-care. If someone takes 'no' personally, it isn’t you; it’s them. Set your boundaries, put yourself first, and listen to what you need. University Resources Below are some of our university resources available for students. Each of these departments have additional off-campus resources listed on their website for times when the university is closed.

Our chapter here at UNC Charlotte is designed to give local, regional, and national recognition to students making outstanding contributions to their residence halls. NACURH firmly believes in the value of student involvement in residence hall life through community service, social programs, and educational programs . NRHH can help you further your commitment to service and recognition, two essential components of a thriving community. Realizing the value of participation, students have contributed vast amounts of their personal time in an effort to make their own college experiences more meaningful to them. This effort not only benefits them but the entire residence hall system at their school as well. There are people who work hard and all too often go unnoticed without even so much as a ”thank you.” NRHH exists to honor these students. Recognizing these student leaders is the fundamental purpose of our NRHH Chapter. NRHH is the only nationwide organization that recognizes residence hall leaders. Membership in our chapter is limited to one percent of UNC Charlotte’s residence hall population, which allows us to have 61 NRHH members. As you can see, it is a very select group of leaders. Being selected into the membership is an honor in which one can take a tremendous amount of pride.",0

https://cognisci.charlotte.edu,Cognitive Science Program,"Cognitive Science Program Director : Dr. Doug Markant ( cog-sci@uncc.edu ) What is Cognitive Science? Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the processes and representations of the mind that enable intelligent thought and action in humans, animals, and machines. Of central concern are cognitive abilities of perception and action, attention and cognitive control, memory, knowledge and language, problem solving, reasoning, decision making, and emotion. Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte Cognitive Science at UNC Charlotte began with the formation of the Cognitive Science Academy, an interdisciplinary community of faculty and students engaged in advancing the discovery, dissemination, and application of knowledge in cognitive science. The program provides an interdisciplinary approach by building upon the strong academic programs that are already in place in its contributing departments—Psychology, Computer Science, Software and Information Systems, Philosophy, English, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Civil Engineering. The Cognitive Science program at UNC Charlotte is committed to social justice, celebration of diversity in background and viewpoints, and inclusion . For more information about our efforts toward these goals, please see the Department of Psychological Science statement on social justice , which summarizes both our philosophy and the actions our faculty are taking to address issues of social injustice and inequity. Undergraduate & Graduate Programs UNC Charlotte offers an undergraduate minor, and a graduate certificate in Cognitive Science. Students in the graduate certificate program may also consider applying for the General Masters in Psychology (Cognitive Option) program offered by the Department of Psychological Science after consulting with their faculty mentor in the graduate certificate program. What careers are available in Cognitive Science? The skills acquired by cognitive science students are applicable in many career fields, particularly those associated with the information industry including telecommunications, information processing, medical analysis, data representation and retrieval, education, scientific research, and multimedia design. Cognitive Science graduates can apply their skills to positions in human factors and computer-human interactions, artificial intelligence (creating computer systems that demonstrate what appears to be intelligent behavior), human performance testing, education, and neurological testing.",0

It focuses upon the forces that organize and structure societies and smaller groups, as well as the forces that disorganize and threaten to dissolve them. As a science, sociology applies an objective and systematic method of investigation to identify the patterns and forms of social life and to understand the processes by which they are established and changed. The study of sociology is attractive to students seeking a liberal education and immediate employment, as well as to those preparing for further study and professional careers. As a liberal arts program, it enables students to understand the social contexts in which they find themselves and the social forces that shape personality, actions, and interactions with others. As a pre-professional program it provides an excellent background for people entering social work, law, teaching, the ministry, journalism, planning, public relations and personnel services. It also provides analytical skills related to market research and program evaluation in human services, sales, management, and other business activities.

The Levens and Emotion and Cognition Lab is an interdisciplinary lab that identifies the mechanisms involved in processing and regulating emotional information, and how individual variability in emotion processing and emotion regulation is associated with individual differences in behavior and a range of mental and physical health outcomes including depression, posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress disorder, food attitudes, obesity and type 2 diabetes. To investigate these mechanistic and behavior relationships we design in-person and online experiments that capitalize on a range of behavioral techniques in a range of populations, including undergraduates, national online samples, individuals with attention deficit disorder, veterans, and individuals who have suffered traumatic experiences. We also regularly collaborate with labs that use physiological, neuroendocrine and functional neuroimaging methodology (including fMRI and EEG).

https://migration.charlotte.edu,Migration Research Network,"Home According to the International Organization for Migration, 272 million people—3.5 percent of the world’s population—live in countries other than where they were born, three times as many as in 1970. Driven by economics, political violence, social dynamics, and climate change, most migrants relocate within their own regions while others move farther away. The top global destination is the United States, where many immigrants now bypass gateways like California and New York to settle in cities and towns in the Southeast. North Carolina is a leading new immigrant destination. Today, nearly 1 in 6 people in Mecklenburg County is foreign-born, up from 1 in 27 in 1990. No matter where they settle—Nairobi, New York, or Charlotte—migrants, hosts, and the communities left behind must find ways to adapt. The Migration Research Network brings together scholars across campus who study migration from multiple disciplinary perspectives. We have regional expertise in Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.

Visualization Highlights Web-based System for Responding to Critical Infrastructure Breakdown When a large scale disaster, such as a hurricane, hits, breakdowns at key points in the electrical grid can cascade over telecommunication, water, gas, road, and other systems. Key facilities, such as schools, police and fire stations, government building, and hospitals, can be affected significantly. In this research funded by DHS, we have developed a Web-based tool to tap into simulations for thousands of different hurricane paths, immediately selecting the one that most closely matches the current event and visualizing the results so they can be rapidly understood and acted upon. The database can also be updated on-the-fly with new simulations that follow the predicted hurricane path. Thus an emergency responder in the field can get updates about when a hurricane will hit her area, where and what parts of the infrastructure will be disrupted, what key facilities will be affected and when.

Light rail also provides greater accessibility for the citizens of the region to the resources of the University. Light rail stations at Ninth Street (beside UNC Charlotte Center City), J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte at North Tryon Street, and the UNC Charlotte Main Station along Cameron Boulevard at Wallis Hall (near North Deck) bring the convenience of light rail to the University’s doorstep. Benefits of light rail The LYNX Blue Line is the Charlotte region’s first light rail service; it opened in 2007. The line operates along 18.6 miles, from I-485 at South Boulevard to the UNC Charlotte campus. With 26 stations, including 11 park-and-ride locations , the LYNX Blue Line provides a congestion-free commute with a consistent travel time. Benefits of using light rail include: Affordable alternative to driving and parking on and off campus Relief from congested traffic Consistent travel time Environmentally clean, affordable transportation Close proximity to arenas, clubs, museums and employment centers Increased economic development and property values faqs Where are the light rail stations that serve UNC Charlotte? There are three light rail stations that serve the main UNC Charlotte campus. The UNC Charlotte Main Station is located along Cameron Boulevard at Wallis Hall (near North Deck). The other stations include J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte at North Tryon Street and Ninth Street (beside UNC Charlotte Center City). The 9th Street light rail station serves The Dubois Center at UNC Center City. How can students and staff use light rail? Students have a CATS All-Access Pass for unlimited rides on the CATS LYNX light rail, trolley, Special Transportation Service (STS), local and express bus routes, including the Airport Connector. Faculty and staff have the option to purchase the same pass at MyPark . CATS privileges are on the CATS-Pass app . Your All-Access Pass will appear in the “Wallet” section of the app. You must show the app to a fare inspector on LYNX light rail or scan your pass on the column when boarding a CATS bus. CATS Special Transportation Service (STS) provides door-to-door transit services within Charlotte’s city limits and the towns of Matthews and Pineville for individuals with disabilities certified as eligible according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). STS vehicles connect with Niner Paratransit for campus service. STS service requires user registration and CATS approval before being eligible to ride. This process takes 30 days on average to complete. Do students or employees with an All-Access Pass still need a ticket to ride? No, light rail and bus privileges are tied to the CATS-Pass app . Download the app to view your All-Access Pass in the “Wallet” section. Show your All-Access Pass when asked by a fare inspector on the train. On a bus, scan your pass on the column to board. If you are issued a citation because you did not have your All-Access Pass, you may appeal the citation with CATS . CATS may decline or approve the appeal at their discretion. UNC Charlotte will not refund citation fines. Can I purchase a CATS All-Access Pass for family or friends? No, only UNC Charlotte students and employees are eligible for the CATS All-Access Passes. You may purchase tickets at light rail station kiosks or use the CATS Pass App . Does bus service connect to the light rail on campus? The campus bus system, Niner Transit , operates Monday through Sunday. Niner Transit stops at the UNC Charlotte Main Station. Visit PassioGO! to see live bus tracking. Is light rail accessible for all riders? Yes. CATS has worked to ensure all light rail stations and trains are accessible for people with disabilities. The University put in place accessible means to and from the campus station, including accessible pedestrian pathways . On campus, Niner Paratransit provides scheduled and on-demand disability transport for those with mobility impairments registered for the service. Designated pick-up and drop-off points are located around campus close as possible to accessible building entrances. Once I get off at UNC Charlotte Main Station, what are my on-campus transportation options? If you prefer not to take a Niner Transit bus to get around, you can also walk or rent a bike or e-scooter from the campus bike and e-scooter rental program . Can I connect directly from Amtrak to the LYNX Blue Line? Currently, there is not a direct link between Amtrak and the LYNX Blue Line. Use a ride-sharing service to access the Parkwood Station via 16th Street or take the 11 – North Tryon bus to either the Charlotte Transportation Center in uptown or J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte Station to transfer to the Blue Line. Can I park at a CATS light rail station? There are 11 Park & Ride stations along the Blue Line, with four on the extension. While parking is free at most Park & Ride stations, CATS charges a $10 exit fee at the J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte and University City Boulevard stations, unless riders have a valid CATS daily, weekly or monthly pass. Riders without a CATS daily, weekly or monthly pass will be required to pay to exit the parking decks at J.W. Clay/UNC Charlotte and University City Boulevard stations. Remember, if you are a UNC Charlotte student, faculty or staff member with a CATS All-Access Transit Pass, your pass does not include parking fees incurred at a CATS facility. I don’t want to purchase a CATS All-Access Transit Pass. How can I purchase a single ticket for the light rail? You can purchase a ticket for light rail from CATS at a ticket vending machine located on every station platform or via the CATS-Pass app . To learn more about pricing, visit the CATS website .

https://chancellor.charlotte.edu,University Leadership | University Leadership | UNC Charlotte,"Welcome to UNC Charlotte! As chancellor of UNC Charlotte, I’m pleased to bring you greetings from Niner Nation! UNC Charlotte was founded just over 75 years ago as a night school catering to returning World War II veterans. We started out serving a class of just 278 students. Today, Charlotte is the third-largest institution in the UNC System, with more than 30,000 students enrolled. We are truly one of the great success stories in American higher education. We are the only public four-year institution serving Charlotte – the largest city in the Carolinas and one of the fastest growing and most dynamic regions in the country. This University is a major talent driver for our region and state, awarding more than 8,000 degrees and graduate certificates annually. To meet new challenges and to support the industries and communities in our region, we are pushing forward on a new vision to power the future for our region as an emerging top-tier global research university. With growing research expenditures, rising national recognition for innovative academic and student success programs, and impactful new partnerships and discoveries, Charlotte is climbing the ranks. This fall, we welcomed our largest-ever class of new first-year students and set a University record for new incoming graduate students. It’s exciting to see that more and more students are taking advantage of the transformative education and opportunities available only at Charlotte. There’s added excitement as the Charlotte 49ers begin competition in the American Athletic Conference. The move brings greater national media exposure and new competition, including in-state rival East Carolina. Charlotte is a great city, and this is Charlotte’s great University. This University is having a measurable impact on our students, their families and on the region and state we serve. I encourage you to learn more about UNC Charlotte and visit our campus. Go Niners!

https://ninerneeds.charlotte.edu,Niner Needs,"UNC Charlotte offers a menu of support services for students struggling to secure basic needs. Basic needs are defined as those needs that hinder students' ability to focus on and successfully complete their academic studies - food insecurity, housing insecurity, homelessness, transportation, health and wellbeing, and technology. Resources for Niners Need Help With Food? Swipe Out Hunger Swipe Out Hunger is a nation-wide program that partners with colleges to help put an end to student hunger and assist those who struggle with food insecurity. Leadership & Community Engagement has partnered with Chartwells Dining Services, Auxiliary Services, Student Assistance and Support Services, and the Sustainability Office to bring this program to UNC Charlotte. Eligibility for Swipe Out Hunger Program at UNC Charlotte: The Swipe Out Hunger Program aims to provide students who are food insecure, and/or who are experiencing an emergency situation, access to healthy and well-balanced meals in our campus dining halls. To be eligible, students must be currently enrolled at UNC Charlotte. If you meet this initial requirement and would like to complete a needs-based assessment to determine your further eligibility for the program, please schedule an appointment with Student Assistance and Support Services by calling 704-687-0289. Swipe Out Hunger Jamil Niner Student Pantry The pantry provides assistance to UNC Charlotte undergraduate and graduate students that struggle with food insecurity. In 2013, the USDA defined food insecurity as a condition that occurs when people do not have enough resources to feed themselves. The Jamil Niner Student Pantry offers a variety of nutritious meals and frequently gives demonstrations on what meals can be made with the food in our pantry. Jamil Niner Student Pantry UNC Charlotte SNAP Screening Over the past few years, nutritionists and University leaders have realized that emerging adults (those between the ages of 18-24 years) struggle to get enough healthy food. Federal programs exist to assist with this challenge. A support program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides approximately $70 billion per year to assist with nutrition. This program — sometimes referred to as “food stamps” or EBT — is administered by state and local governments. In North Carolina, this program is called Food and Nutrition Services (FNS). Here at UNC Charlotte, we believe that there are a number of students that may benefit from this nutrition assistance program. To see if you may be eligible students and faculty from the Department of Public Health Sciences created the following screening tool and application instructions for interested students. The template and examples highlighted below are based on the Coordinated SNAP Outreach process originally developed by Rebecca Leighton at Boynton Health at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. If you apply and are found eligible you will get a debit card in the mail that will be loaded with money each month that you can use for food. The amount of money will depend on your income and household information — we expect the amount to be somewhere between $15 to $125 per month. Before you jump to Step 1, please note the following: When answering the screener questions use your current living situation. For example, you might live with your parents in the summer and during university breaks, but if you are living in an off-campus apartment at the time you complete this screener, answer the questions based on your apartment living situation. Residents of North Carolina complete a county SNAP/FNS application (discussed in item #3 below) for the county in which they reside at the time of their application completion. If you are living in Charlotte during the school year, you are considered a Charlotte-Mecklenburg resident. If you currently live outside of North Carolina (ex. You live in SC but commute to UNC Charlotte), the UNC Charlotte SNAP Screener will indicate if you are likely or unlikely eligible for SNAP, but when you try to actually apply for SNAP benefits, you’ll need to click here for details regarding SNAP services in your state of residence. If you complete the SNAP/FNS application and are approved, a SNAP debit card will be sent to you in the mail. At that time, you will have a certain amount of money added to your SNAP card once a month for 6-months. You would need to re-certify after 6 months. Directions Complete Step 1 below to see if you are likely eligible for SNAP. Complete the Mecklenburg County Screener in Step 2 if the UNC Charlotte Screener indicates that you are likely eligible for SNAP before completing the actual SNAP application. To apply for SNAP benefits, use the link in Step 3. Step 1 Complete this brief 3-4 question UNC Charlotte SNAP Screener to help assess your eligibility. Step 2 Watch this video once you complete the screening tool. If you want to assess your eligibility in more detail, complete the Mecklenburg County Screener . Otherwise go directly to the application. Minute Markers for the video: 0:00 - 3:25 (Walkthrough of Mecklenburg County Screener) 3:25-15:21 (End) (Walkthrough of SNAP/FNS Application) Step 3 Click for Mecklenburg County Screener and the SNAP/FNS Application This screening tool was developed by the state of North Carolina and is specific to Mecklenburg County residents. You should hear back about your results in the next 30 days. If you receive SNAP benefits, please use this link to access retail locations where you can use your SNAP card in your area. You may also use the map feature to see these locations, including those near campus. Note: At this time there are no current food vendors on UNC Charlotte’s campus that offer SNAP benefits.

https://helpseeking.charlotte.edu,Help Seeking Protocol – Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution,"Student Accountability Toggle Submenu Process & Resolution Options In Absentia Resolution Hazing Education Alternatives to Hazing Hazing Myths University Jurisdiction Help Seeking Protocol Educational Outcomes Student Accountability Board Student Board Member Recruitment Help Seeking Protocol Substance Use Help Seeking Protocol A priority of UNC Charlotte is students’ health, safety, and welfare. Students are expected to demonstrate compassion by seeking help in potentially dangerous or life-threatening situations. The University does not want the fear of repercussions to be a barrier for seeking help. The Help Seeking Protocol provides students an opportunity to seek help for themselves or others while being connected to campus and community resources, in lieu of Accountability Procedures through the University. FAQs When does the help seeking protocol apply? The Help Seeking Protocol applies to the following circumstances regarding the possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs: students who seek assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on their own behalf; students who seek assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on behalf of another person(s) and who remain present until emergency personnel or University officials arrive; students who had assistance from emergency personnel or University officials sought on their behalf; organizations in which a representative(s) seeks assistance from emergency personnel or University officials on behalf of another person(s) and who remains present until emergency personnel or University officials arrive; or students and/or organizations who are victims and/or witnesses of a crime (including, but not limited to, sexual misconduct, interpersonal violence, assault, theft, or vandalism) and may have simultaneously violated University policy regarding the possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs. When does the help seeking protocol not apply? The Help Seeking Protocol does not apply to the following circumstances: students who are confronted by emergency personnel or University officials without having sought help or having help sought on their behalf law enforcement agencies working within their jurisdictions enforcing federal, state, or local laws (however, state laws related to medical amnesty may apply); or students who are engaging in behaviors other than possession, consumption, or use of alcohol and/or drugs (including, but not limited to, driving under the influence, manufacturing/distribution/delivery of drugs, possessing with intent to manufacture/distribute/deliver drugs, sexual misconduct, or interpersonal violence). How is the help seeking protocol initiated? When the Help Seeking Protocol is initiated, the student or an organizational representative will be required to meet with a staff member from Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution to discuss the incident and available campus and community resources. The student or organization must agree to a recommended action plan, which may include a referral to the University’s Center for Wellness Promotion, referrals to other campus and/or community resources, educational programming, and/or parental notification. A student or organization, who fails to attend the required meeting or fails to complete any agreed upon action plan, will no longer be eligible for the Protocol and may be referred for Accountability Procedures, as outlined in University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility . Initiation of the Help Seeking Protocol is at the discretion of the Director of Student Accountability & Conflict Resolution or designee, who will consider all relevant facts in making the decision. If students or organizational representatives believe the Protocol applies, they are encouraged to contact the Director. Decisions on initiation of the Protocol are final and not appealable.",0

https://motorsports.charlotte.edu,Motorsports Engineering,"Home Looking for a career in motorsports? UNC Charlotte Motorsports is located in the heart of NASCAR country and is the first stop for employers hiring interns and entry level engineers. Within 50 miles of 90% of the NASCAR Cup Teams Five miles from Charlotte Motor Speedway, just past the checkered flag Over 22% of all NASCAR Cup Series engineers are UNC Charlotte graduates. The UNC Charlotte Alan D. Kulwicki Motorsports Laboratory is named after the 1992 Winston Cup Champion and engineer, Alan Kulwicki. The Alan D. Kulwicki Motorsports Laboratory offers students 6800 square feet of training space, one of the largest in the Southeast. Our program is rigorous and well respected in the automotive and racing industries. We offer one of the most innovative “hands-on” programs available in the U.S., allowing our students to be some of the most qualified applicants in motorsports. The cars built and raced by our students are their own design. Student designed. Student built. Student raced. We ensure that our students have the opportunity to learn the theory that will help them on the race track or in an automotive manufacturing facility. They are exposed to some of the most well respected professionals in the racing and automotive industries, adding high level practical experience as a potential part of the training. Formula SAE (Internal Combustion & Electric) In Honor of Our Benefactor UNC Charlotte’s connection with the legacy of Alan Kulwicki began in 1994 when R.J. Reynolds and racing fans helped establish the Alan Kulwicki Memorial Scholarship. Presented annually to an outstanding high school senior who has an affiliation with racing and is planning to major in mechanical engineering at UNC Charlotte, the four-year scholarship honors the memory of Kulwicki, who died in 1993. Kulwicki was the first full-time driver in stock car racing to have a college degree in engineering. A trailblazer in the modern era of NASCAR racing, he was the first college graduate to win the NASCAR season championship and the first person to both own and drive for his own team. Kulwicki was a strong supporter of engineering and science education. His success helped to launch a new generation of motorsports engineering in NASCAR and at UNC Charlotte.

https://publichealth.charlotte.edu,Department of Public Health Sciences,"Follow Us open positions Welcome Message from the Chair A time of Growth and Opportunity I am thrilled to share some incredibly exciting news with you. The College of Health and Human Services has been approved to transition to an accredited School of Public Health. We will become only the second accredited School of Public Health in North Carolina. The Department of Public Health Sciences has played a key role in advancing this goal and the next few years will be transformative as we navigate a larger presence on campus and in the community. Importantly for PHS, our Department will be growing. Just as a cell undergoes binary fission to multiply and grow, our department will experience a similar process; PHS will become two distinct academic departments . I firmly believe that this change will enhance our collective impact – elevating our degree programs, our students and our research within the field of public health. Two Thriving Entities : One department will house our existing Master of Health Administration (MHA) and BS in Health System Management degrees. Additionally, that unit will offer a new MPH concentration in Health Policy (stay tuned for more information about that development!). The other department will house our BS in Public Health, MPH with concentrations in Community Health Practice and Epidemiology, and our two PhD programs (one in Public Health Sciences and the other in Epidemiology). Both departments will maintain the high standards and collaborative spirit that define us. This change is not about separation but about multiplication — creating two strong pillars that will support our overarching mission of promoting health and well-being in an urbanizing world. Read more… In the coming weeks, you can expect more detailed information about the expansion, including department names, leadership structures, departmental foci, and new initiatives that each department and the College will undertake. We encourage everyone to embrace this change with an open mind and an enthusiasm for the possibilities that lie ahead.

https://legalstudies.charlotte.edu,Home | Legal Studies Minor | UNC Charlotte,"Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of law and society and business. The purpose of the Legal Studies minor is to enhance a liberal arts education across traditional disciplines, focusing on the theory and operation of law and legal institutions. The courses in the Legal Studies minor will expose students to the many facets of law as a social phenomenon – its evolution, function, motivating ideas and effects. In addition to fostering critical thinking and other transferable skills, the broad base of knowledge about law-related topics that students acquire in this minor better positions them for employment in governmental and nonprofit agencies, as well as business, where legal knowledge is beneficial.

https://anthropology.charlotte.edu,Department of Anthropology,"Home anthropology is the study of the human species. The discipline of Anthropology advances our collective understanding of who we are, where we came from, how we differ from one another, and what those differences mean . Anthropology is rooted in core values of mutual respect, equal rights, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination. As one of its early practitioners, Ruth Benedict of Columbia University, wrote, the goal of anthropology “is a world made safe for difference.” Earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Anthropology prepares students with the research skills and conceptual tools they need to enter any field or profession that benefits from understanding the causes and the range of variation in human experience, activity, identity, and values. Our alumni currently work in financial services, education, law, medicine, government, social services, the arts, and in corporate settings ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small family businesses. Read more >> addressing structural inequalities As the study of humanity and our closest relatives in the past and present, teaching and research in the Department of Anthropology at UNC Charlotte examine these topics using rigorous methods and theoretical perspectives which can generate knowledge in the service of social equity and human dignity. Anthropological approaches are well suited for understanding diversity, relations of power, and addressing a range of contemporary problems and injustices. This work requires continuing critical reflection on the way that histories of capitalist expansion and colonization have shaped the institutions in which we conduct our work, the academic disciplines we develop, and the conceptual frameworks through which we view the world. Because systemic forms of discrimination, exploitation, and marginalization can interfere with the ability of students and faculty to conduct research, to teach, and to learn, our goals must include the effort to identify, understand, resist, and dismantle these systems. graduate study at charlotte Watch our informational video about our program and applications for Fall 2023.

We view gender as a category of analysis that includes women, men, transgender, and gender-nonconforming individuals. Using a feminist perspective, the program seeks to understand the cultural, political, and historical processes that gender human identity and society. In our research, teaching, programming, and service we explore gender as it intersects with multiple categories, such as race, ethnicity, social class, age, ability, nationality, and sexuality. Recognizing that gender varies widely over time and space, the program emphasizes a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, with faculty employing a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches. The Women's and Gender Studies Program at UNC Charlotte offers an undergraduate minor in Women's and Gender Studies and a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies. Women's and Gender Studies also has an Honor Society called Iota Iota Iota (Triota). Our curriculum prepares students to understand how gender has shaped their own lives, the lives of others, the production of knowledge, and social institutions. Our undergraduate and graduate coursework also emphasizes the link between theory and practice and encourages applied learning through internships, community involvement, and service learning. Our curriculum is designed to develop a gender-sensitive perspective that will influence students' academic, professional, and personal development. It is our hope that this gender-sensitive perspective will lead students to ask the kinds of critical questions that are essential to imagining and creating an inclusive and equitable society.

SEP is a partnership between the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities (USU), the College Transition Collaborative (CTC), the Project for Education Research that Scales (PERTS), EducationCounsel, and five partner institutions: Colorado State University, Portland State University, the University of Colorado-Denver, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Toledo. About The Student Experience Project The Student Experience Project (SEP) is a collaboration of university leaders, faculty, researchers, and national education organizations committed to innovative, research-based practices to increase degree attainment by building equitable learning environments and fostering a sense of belonging on campus. The Challenge Colleges and universities are enrolling more diverse student populations than ever before. Yet, one-third of new college students will not graduate within six years. There remains a need for additional support and action to provide every student with an equal opportunity to graduate from college. Research has shown that under-represented minorities, low-income, and first-generation students do not do as well in our classrooms as their counterparts. Some of the forces contributing to these differential outcomes are extrinsic — students’ prior academic experiences or the off-campus jobs they must hold down to pay for college. But, as uncomfortable as it is, we must also acknowledge that there are intrinsic factors at play because there is evidence that faculty’s beliefs about mindset manifest in how students experience the course’s design, syllabus, pedagogy, and classroom environment — predicts outcomes. UNC Charlotte’s Faculty Avengers The Faculty Avengers Community of Practice started in the Fall of 2019. The goal of the instructor team is to create a continuous support network in which instructors can learn together, share ideas, and develop resources to support equity in classes. Together, we have implemented evidence-based changes in their classroom that have improved students’ sense of belonging, identity safety, social connectedness, and growth mindset.

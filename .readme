# Semantic Web Search - University of North Carolina at Charlotte

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for our Semantic Web Search project at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This project serves as the final capstone project for the course Intelligent Systems - ITCS 6150.

In total, the project consists of three main components, which in turn are deisgned as a complete machine learning pipeline. The three components are as follows:

1. A [web crawler](#web-crawler) that scrapes the UNCC' site for data, preprocesses, and stores it in a database.
2. A [semantic web search engine](#semantic-web-search-engine) that allows users to search for information on the UNCC' site using natural language queries.
3. A [web interface](#web-interface) that allows users to interact with the search engine.

## Web Crawler

The web crawler is responsible for scraping the UNCC' site for data, preprocessing it, and storing it in a database. The crawler is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

## Semantic Web Search Engine

The semantic web search engine allows users to search for information on the UNCC' site using natural language queries. The search engine is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

## Web Interface

The web interface allows users to interact with the search engine. The interface is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the following libraries:

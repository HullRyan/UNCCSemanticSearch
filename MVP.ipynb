    "## Introduction\n",
    "The University of North Carolina at Charlotte's website hosts a vast array of information, yet finding specific content can be challenging using traditional search methods. Our project aims to introduce a semantic search engine that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to understand and interpret user queries contextually, aiming for significantly improved accuracy and relevance in search results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "Our objective is to develop a search engine that enhances traditional keyword matching by employing machine learning algorithms to analyze and understand the context and intent behind user queries. The challenge lies in effectively processing and interpreting the expansive and diverse content on the university's website, requiring a holistic approach to data preprocessing, semantic analysis, and embedding generation in an ML pipeline.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology begins with recursive/deep crawling the University’s website, preprocessing the site data, including the extraction and cleaning of text. Following this, we will generate context aware summaries using a pre-trained LLM model, then create embeddings in a similar manner to capture the semantic meaning of texts. For the search engine's development, we plan to embed user queries and perform similarity searches on our embeddings database, utilizing a small custom front-end web application for communication to the user. Finally, we will evaluate the search engine's performance with A-B testing against the UNC Charlotte website.`\n"

    "### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this project we explored several different ways to traverse and collect website data while utilizing Python libraries such as beautifulsoup and Playwright. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a recursive web crawler approach, we were able to traverse the entire website and collect all the text data from the website. This resulting in an large dataset >4GB of text data alone (later skimmed down to ~47mb), and over 14,000 sites. While this worked, we found that the data was too large to process in a reasonable amount of time, as well as included various sources of outdated information that were not ideal or wanted in our project. In the end we have two datasets, one that is a subset of the entire website with stop-words removed and limits to path count (allowing for filtering by path count or subdomain) called endpoints.csv and another manually picked test set which we will demonstrate in this pipeline, called subdomain_test_set.csv. Note that the text data in these datasets is not the full text data, but rather a subset of the text data that was collected from the website and cleaned. However, no manual cleaning was done to the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How we chose our test set\n",
    "\n",
    "The test we will demonstrate includes pages from the main website, as well as any base path for subdomains that we found. The length of the pages ranged from a few paragraphs to a few pages of text. We chose these pages because they were the most relevant to the main website and would be the most likely to be searched for, as well as show a diverse range of text data and topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main libraries used here are `requests`, `concurrent.futures`, and `BeautifulSoup`, in order to crawl a domain, extract links and text from the HTML content of each page, and write the results to a CSV file. We also included some error handling and progress reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallelization**: Our method uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to fetch multiple URLs at the same time. This can significantly speed up the web scraping, but it also adds complexity. In practice we found that for small datasets it is not necessary to use parallelization, but for larger datasets it increases speed linearlly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error handling**: The code includes several `try`/`except` blocks to handle exceptions that might occur when fetching a URL or processing the HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Progress reporting**: We display the progress of the web scraping, including the most recent URL and status, and the total number of successes and failures, making it useful to see progress in long running tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Link and text extraction**: The code includes logic to extract links and text from the HTML content, resolve relative links to absolute links, and remove certain sections of the page (like JavaScript and CSS blocks, headers, footers, etc.). These were improved upon by trial and error, and may not be perfect, but they work well for the most part and can be improved upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **URL validation and filtering**: We include logic to validate URLs and filter out certain URLs based on a list of excluded terms. This is necessary to avoid crawling irrelevant or unwanted pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code does not handle JavaScript-heavy websites well, and may not be able to extract all the text from such websites. This is because the code only processes the HTML content of a page, and does not execute JavaScript. This is a limitation of the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, and would require a more complex solution to solve such as using a headless browser like Playwright or Selenium. This switch would also allow for more complex interactions with the website, such as clicking buttons or filling out forms, which would be useful for more complex websites, however it would also slow down the process significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is currently only useful for public sites only, as it does not handle authentication or cookies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could improve the code to handle JavaScript-heavy websites by using a headless browser like Playwright or Selenium. This would allow us to execute JavaScript and extract the text from the rendered page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently we store the page data for every visited page, and later process and filter out the data set we want to be able to search over. This limits our calls to the site, however is not ideal. If we define the filters we want during the preprocessing step, we could avoid storing the data we don't want in the first place. Traversal of the entire site would still be necessary, but we could avoid storing the data we don't want.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additionally, storing the entirely html could allow for comparing the hash of the html to see if the page has changed, and only storing the new data / sending it through the pipeline. This would allow for a more up to date dataset and search engine, and would allow for the dataset to be updated over time in a more efficient manner. \n"

    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data preprocessing phase of our project, we employed Python's powerful pandas library to refine and transform our raw dataset into a structured format suitable for further analysis and usage in our semantic search engine. The process involved several crucial steps, each aimed at improving the quality and relevance of the data extracted during the collection phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Data Cleaning\n",
    "The first step involved importing the raw dataset from a CSV file and removing any rows where essential information was missing. Specifically, we dropped entries without valid 'URL' or 'Text' fields to ensure that only complete records were processed further, as we;; as. This initial cleaning helps in reducing noise and focusing on meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering URLs\n",
    "We applied filters to remove URLs containing specific terms that were deemed irrelevant or unwanted for our project's scope. By applying a custom lambda function, we could efficiently exclude URLs based on a defined list of terms, thereby narrowing down our dataset to include only the content relevant to our objectives. In this case, we filtered out URLs containing `?`, since these are often dynamic pages containing search parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting and Filtering by Structural Attributes\n",
    "To better understand the website's architecture and prioritize content, we sorted the data based on the URL path count and text length. Entries were ordered by their path complexity to identify and segregate main pages from deeper, potentially less relevant subpages. Additionally, we filtered out text data that fell below a certain length threshold, focusing on substantial content that is more likely to be of interest to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deduplication and Final Arrangement\n",
    "Duplicate URLs were removed to avoid redundant processing and to ensure the uniqueness of each data point in our dataset. This deduplication step is critical for maintaining a clean and efficient search index. Furthermore, we sorted the remaining entries based on URL length to prioritize shorter, typically more significant URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Conversion and Export\n",
    "The final step in our preprocessing involved converting the cleaned DataFrame back into a list format for compatibility with subsequent processing stages and exporting the refined dataset back into CSV format for easy access and use in future tasks. This step marks the transition from raw to processed data, ready for integration into our semantic search pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "While our preprocessing methods have significantly improved dataset usability, they are primarily designed for structured, text-based content and might not handle non-textual data or highly dynamic content effectively. Moreover, the manual selection of filter terms and length thresholds requires domain knowledge and might not capture all nuances of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvements\n",
    "In future iterations, we aim to enhance our preprocessing pipeline by incorporating natural language processing techniques for better text analysis and by developing more sophisticated criteria for URL filtering and text relevance assessment. Automating the selection of filter terms and thresholds based on data characteristics and user feedback could also enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of our preprocessing steps.\n"

    "### Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summarization phase of our project, we utilized a pre-trained language model to generate context-aware summaries of the text data extracted from the University's website. The goal of this phase was to distill the content of each page into concise, informative summaries that capture the essence of the original text and facilitate semantic analysis and embedding generation. An important focus was to ensure the url path and subdomain added context to the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Selection \n",
    "There are many pre-trained language models available, and it is an ever improving and growing list. For our project we wanted an open-source, instruct based, and smaller sized LLM that could run reliably on Google Colab and 8gb GPUs. In the end we chose [Google's Gemma-2b-it model](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b-it), as through our initial compairson and research it provided a good balance of performance and size for our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment Setup\n",
    "We initiated our summarization process by setting up the necessary environment and determining whether the process was running on Google Colab to access specific resources and manage authentication securely. This setup included configuring our model and tokenizer with appropriate parameters for optimal performance across local and cloud-based environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Generation Mechanism\n",
    "Our approach employed a structured instructive prompt tailored to guide the LLM in producing summaries that encapsulate the main topics, purpose, and relevant keywords of each website. This instructive technique ensures that the model's output is aligned with our project's informational needs, providing a standardized format for the extracted summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Enhancements and Innovations\n",
    "To improve the speed performance of the model We incorporated optimizations such as quantization by tested varying precisions (float16, bfloat16, 8-bit, 4-bit) without seeing any significant accuracy degredation. Quantization allows for adjustments to computational efficiency, allowing our model to run effectively even in resource-constrained environments like personal laptops or less powerful cloud services. We mainly focused on using GPU's for our model, however we understand that in a Production pipeline the summarization process may not have time constraints as a batched process and could be run on a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges and Limitations\n",
    "Despite our approach, our summarization process is still computationally intensive and requires substantial resources to execute efficiently. We were able to reliably run our process on Google Colab's free T4 tier, however run close to the resource limits during long runs. Additionally, the quality and relevance of the generated summaries can vary based on the size of our input data and the model's inherent biases and limitations, necessitating review of the output for consistency and accuracy. If this were a critical or customer facing application, we would need to thoroughly ensure that the summaries are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Directions and Improvements\n",
    "Looking ahead, we aim to integrate headless browser solutions like Playwright or Selenium, enabling our system to execute and interpret JavaScript, thereby capturing the full range of content available on modern websites. Additionally, refining our model's ability to discern and disregard irrelevant data during preprocessing could further streamline our summarization process, reducing computational overhead and improving the relevacy of our summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other ideas for future improvements include:\n",
    "* Using a more powerful model, or API based inferences from much larger or private models for generated summaries.\n",
    "* Flagging or adding additional context to prompts based on URL or subdomain, to add context to the summary.\n",
    "* Re-archetecturing our implementation to allow for easier switching between models, or to allow for multiple models to be run in parallel or subsequentally to compare results programmatically.\n",
    "* Tree-based summarization/ data structure, where we summarize based on levels of sub-domain and path. This would allow for a more structured and organized summary, and would allow for more complex queries/filters later during our semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our project's LLM Summary Generation phase represents a significant step in automating content comprehension and summarization, offering a scalable solution to process and distill vast quantities of web data into actionable insights."

    "### Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the semantic analysis phase of our project, we aimed to generate embeddings for the text data extracted from the University's website. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and enable our search engine to understand and interpret user queries contextually, thereby enhancing the relevance and accuracy of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings Creation\n",
    "We utilized the Txtai library, and specifically the `txtai.Embeddings` module with the pre-trained model `sebastian-hofstaetter/distilbert-dot-tas_b-b256-msmarco`. This model transforms the textual content from each web page into dense vector representations, capturing the underlying meanings and relationships within the data. The embedding process converts the summaries, topics, and tags extracted from each page into a format suitable for semantic search, thereby enhancing the relevance and precision of our search engine. There are many different models and methods for creating embeddings, and we chose this one because it was easy to use and had good performance for our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "Prior to embedding, we prepared the text data by combining URLs, summaries, topics, and tags into a single, displayable text format. This consolidation was necessary to ensure that the model could consider all relevant information when generating embeddings. Additionally, we implemented error handling to manage missing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Search Capability\n",
    "Once the embeddings were generated, they were indexed to enable efficient semantic search across our dataset. The `embeddings.index()` function was utilized to associate each web page's URL with its corresponding embedding, laying the groundwork for our search functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "We developed two primary functions for interacting with the indexed data:\n",
    "- `search(query, max_results=5)`: This function allows users to perform semantic searches within our dataset. By inputting a query, the function retrieves the most semantically relevant web pages, demonstrating the practical application of our embeddings in real-world search scenarios.\n",
    "- `explain(query, max_results=5)`: In addition to the standard search functionality, we implemented an 'explain' feature. This function provides insight into the reasons behind the search results, offering users transparency and a deeper understanding of the search engine’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Methods\n",
    "Our implementation relies on the robust capabilities of the txtai library. The underlying technology is not new, but txtai provides a simple and effective interface for generating embeddings and performing semantic searches. During our initial research we explored how the library works by utilizing [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net) to create and store our own embeddings in a in-memory database. In a production use case we would likely use a more powerful and scalable database, such as Elasticsearch, to store and search our embeddings and have more control over the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "While our semantic analysis and embedding generation have significantly enhanced our project's capabilities, there are limitations. The process is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the initial text data. Moreover, as the embeddings are based on pre-trained models, there may be constraints related to the specificity and domain relevance of these models. Additionally, the embedding model will need to be able to run on command to embed user queries, so the size of the model is a consideration for where and how the server will be hosted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "Looking ahead, we aim to refine our embedding generation by experimenting with different models and tuning parameters to better suit our specific dataset and use cases. Additionally, enhancing our error handling and data preparation methods will improve the robustness and effectiveness of our semantic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also believe there exists an oportunity for extremely cost effective semantic search capabilities by using [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index), which would allow for the embedding generation and search to be done client side, and would allow for a more scalable and cost effective solution. This would also allow for more complex queries and filters to be run client side, and would allow for a more interactive and dynamic search experience. More testing of the limitations and capabilities of this for large datasets would be necessary.\n"

    "### Search Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In the search engine phase of our project, we developed a small custom front-end web application to communicate with the user and demonstrate the capabilities of our semantic search engine. The application allows users to input queries and receive relevant search results, showcasing the practical application of our semantic analysis and embedding generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Integration and Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development phase of our project, we integrated two primary functionalities into our web service: `search` and `explain`, both critical to our semantic analysis system. Utilizing the Flask web framework, renowned for its ease of use and flexibility, we crafted a lightweight, RESTful API service designed to interface seamlessly with our backend logic and data embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed two endpoints within our Flask application: `/search` and `/explain`, corresponding to our core functionalities. These endpoints accept POST requests, aligning with standard API practices for data transmission and retrieval, ensuring both security and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Endpoint**:\n",
    "    - This endpoint facilitates querying the embeddings index to find the most relevant information based on user input. It decodes the JSON payload from client requests to extract the 'query' and 'max_results' parameters, providing a user-friendly interface for data querying.\n",
    "    - Upon receiving a query, it interacts with the `search` function, which utilizes our pre-processed and indexed data, returning a list of results sorted by relevance. This process encapsulates the essence of semantic search by leveraging natural language understanding to fetch pertinent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explain Endpoint**:\n",
    "    - Similar to the search functionality but with an added layer of interpretability, this endpoint provides insights into the query results. It helps users understand why certain pieces of information were deemed relevant by detailing the matching process.\n",
    "    - This transparency is crucial for applications requiring a deeper understanding of AI-driven decisions, enhancing user trust and system accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Design and User Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "Our API design prioritizes simplicity and efficiency, making it accessible to developers and end-users alike. By employing the Flask framework, we benefited from its minimalistic yet powerful features, enabling rapid development and deployment. The choice of POST methods for both endpoints aligns with best practices for APIs, ensuring data encapsulation and enhancing security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask application is configured to run in debug mode, facilitating real-time feedback and immediate error logging during the development process. This feature accelerates debugging and streamlines the testing phase, allowing for a more agile development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "As the project evolves, we anticipate extending the API's capabilities, incorporating additional endpoints, and refining existing ones to accommodate a broader range of queries and use cases. Continuous integration of user feedback and performance metrics will guide these enhancements, ensuring the API remains robust, user-centric, and aligned with evolving project goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of our Flask-based API represents a significant milestone in our project, bridging the gap between complex backend algorithms and user-facing applications. It exemplifies a successful integration of semantic technologies with web services, paving the way for advanced search and analysis tools accessible through straightforward, RESTful interfaces.\n"
